1) HOW TO PLAY
  The object of the game is to clear eight castles, with four stages each, to 
rescue Princess Min-Min. Jacky and Lee, the heroes, must defeat 12 enemies in 
each stage to open the door to the next. They will be challenged by a variety of
enemies which have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Jacky and Lee must collect
the 10 treasures and other power-ups to attack these weaknesses.

Start
  Starts the game, pauses and unpauses.

Select
  Choose 1 or 2 players before starting.

D-pad
  Move in the direction pressed. (no diagonals)

A button
  Punch in the facing direction to attack enemies and blocks and to pick up 
items. The character stops moving while punching. The power and speed of the 
punch is denoted by the number by the fist symbol. This is increased by 
collecting punch power-ups. Some enemies require a minimum punch power to be 
defeated. If the sword is drawn, this is a sword strike instead of a punch.

B button with D-pad
  Flip-kick in the direction pressed. Attack enemies or pick up items by landing
on them. A kick cannot attack blocks but can reveal treasures hidden in the 
ground. The speed and direction can be changed with the D-pad. (diagonals 
allowed) While in the air, the character can jump over pits and cannot be hurt 
except by hazard fireballs and moving walls.

B button without D-pad
  Perform a miracle kick. The number available is displayed next to the "K" 
symbol. Collect miracle kicks, five at a time, from treasure chests. The miracle
kick is faster and longer lasting than a regular kick, and works against some 
enemies where a regular kick doesn't.

A+B without D-pad
  Cause a P ball to be created on the playfield. This requires six $-bags.

A+B with D-pad
  Draw or put away the sword. The sword must be found first.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) POWER-UPS
  Power-ups are revealed by hitting certain blocks, and sometimes empty ground. 
Except for the ?-ball, which appears at random from hitting blocks, all power-up
locations are fixed. 

?-ball
  These are created randomly when punching blocks. When collected, the ?-ball 
may turn out to be one of the two following items.

    $-bag
      Collect five and an E-ball will be created on the playfield. When six
    $-bags are collected, they can be spent to create a P-ball. The maximum
    number that can be stored is six.

    X-ball
      This causes the $ bag count to drop to zero. Usually two or three $-bags 
    appear in a stage before an X-ball turns up.

E-ball
  Collect five for an extra life.

G-ball
  A fireball is launched in the facing direction when punching. Some enemies 
require more than one hit, and and it doesn't work on some enemies. While the 
G-ball is active, enemies run away and the music stops. The effect last about 
13.3 seconds.

P-ball
  The character becomes invincible (except from pits, hazard fireballs and 
moving walls) and can kill enemies by touching them. Enemies turn blue and run 
away while it is active. The "open stairs" tone also plays. The effect last 
about 13.3 seconds.
  Usually P-balls are only available by using $-bags, but there is one in 7-1.

1-up
  Grants an extra life (up to nine).

Key
  Opens a stairway to a Warp or Bonus Stage. The stairs disappear if not used 
for about 10 seconds.

Treasure box
  A treasure box may contain a punch power-up, five miracle kicks, or one of 
the following special treasures.

    Shorin Temple Mark A (white square with brown "S")
      Makes it easier to defeat Mr. Coffin.

    Shorin Temple Mark B (brown square with white "S")
      Shortens the stun time of Cat mage's stun beam.

      Makes it easier to defeat Cat mage and Medusa cat.

    the attack. Does not work on Cat mage beams.

3) BONUSES

Item pickup
  All power-ups are worth 300 pts when collected.

$ bag bonus
  Gain an additional 1000 pts if a ?-ball turns out to be a $ bag.

Dodge bonus
  Jump over a projectile launched by an enemy and gain 1,000 or 3,000 pts upon 
safely landing.

Flying block
  Blocks may randomly fly off in the direction they are punched, killing any 
enemies they hit for increasing point values up to 3000. (500, 1000, 3000, ...)
Some enemies are not hurt by flying blocks.

P-ball bonus
  Increasing point values up to 3000 are granted for every enemy defeated with a
P-ball, (500, 1000, 3000, ...) instead of the regular point values. 

Bonus stage
  Collect bonus apples and E-balls for 30 seconds. The E-ball count in the bonus
stage is separate from the count in the main game. Unlimited miracle kicks are 
available here, which help for moving around quickly. Getting hit by the bullets
does not cost a life but ends the stage.

Apple
  In the bonus stage, apples are worth 1000 pts when collected and an additional
1000 pts at the end of the stage.

Warp
  Skip to the first stage one or two castles ahead by going down either well. 
Wait 10 seconds or jump in the pit to be returned to the current stage.

Break time
  Upon breaking the block, the character immediately goes to a break room and 
gains 500,000 pts. Press start to avoid waiting the full 30 seconds.

Moving platform
  Jumping onto a sinking or moving block grants 1,000,000 pts, and one or more 
E-balls appear. It's best to immediately jump off after landing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The names are from the manual. Enemies with nondescript names have descrip-

Hazards have no effect on enemies.

Pits
  Wells, pools and black gaps may be jumped over.

the mirror to stay safe.

character.

Golems
  The Buddha figures in some stages periodically shoot bullets from the top to 
the bottom of the screen.

Moving wall
  These look like moving platforms but are over solid ground. Like fireballs, 
they can kill a jumping character.

8) FINAL WORDS

  The game is less difficult and more fun with two players.

  Each player has his own score and supply of lives and miracle kicks. Other 
power-ups are shared.

  Losing a life does not cause any power loss; Punch power-ups and treasures 
are permanent.

  To continue after Game Over, hold A while pressing start at the player select.
Gameplay resumes at the beginning of the current castle. Score, E-balls, $-bags 
and miracle kicks are reset to zero.

  After losing a life and coming back, the character has a grace period of 
invincibility lasting 3 seconds or until an attack is made.

  Use the quick passages (box-like structures) at the sides of most levels to 
escape enemies. The enemies can use the quick passages as well, to escape you.

  Save $-bags and P-balls for difficult stages.

  Avoid collecting ?-balls when you already have six $-bags, since you will lose
them if an X-ball turns up.

  Enemies appear four at a time, and do not stop coming no matter how many are 
defeated.
