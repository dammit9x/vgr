                        In times beyond memory, people
                      fought for their lives in a world
                      where monsters and magicians held
                     sway in places of power and mystery.

                      In those days, heroic adventurers
                     went forth on perilous journeys to
                     prove their courage against their
                        foes in battles to the death.

ABOUT SORCERIAN

  Sorcerian debuted in 1987 for the PC-8801, an old PC produced by NEC. (For 
reference, this was the same year Zelda was released on NES.) It featured what 
today are considered standard elements in any action-RPG video game: customiz-
able parties, a dynamic statistic and level-up system, upgradable equipment, 
and plenty of dungeon-crawling challenges. Later addon packs brought new 
features (such as the sound test) and many new scenarios to the original. Since 
then it has been ported to many platforms, including Windows, Sega Mega Drive 
(Genesis) and Dreamcast, NEC PC Engine (Turbo Grafx) and even mobile phone. 
The Mega Drive port is notable because it had only 10 scenarios, but all were 
unique to that version. Many soundtracks and art collections have been 
released. However, it has never been well known in the West due to a lack of 
interest in foreign markets on the part of Falcom.
  Sorcerian was only ported to English speakers once. In 1990, a version was 
translated and distributed in North America by Sierra On-Line for the Microsoft 
DOS platform. That is the version for which this FAQ was written. The DOS 
version has the 15 original missions, along with the game improvements brought 
by the 1988 Utility pack. It is probably a faithful port of one of the versions 
for NEC PC. However, it lacks the mission packs that were available for other 
PC systems (which increased the number of scenarios to 50) and is technically 
inferior to later versions such as the Turbo CD. It is the only option for 
English speakers though.

  It is of note that Sorcerian is part 5 of Falcom's "Dragon Slayer" series, a 
collection of games related only by fantasy theme:

      I.    Dragon Slayer
      II.   Xanadu (includes the familiar Faxanadu for NES)
      III.  Romancia
      IV.   Dragon Slayer Chapter IV
      V.    Sorcerian
      VI.   Dragon Slayer Legend of Heroes
      VII.  Lord Monarch
      VIII. The Legend of Xanadu

  2. MAIN MENU

START ADVENTURE: First choose one of the 3 available mission suites, then 
 choose one of the 5 missions. In general, the difficulty increases from the 
 1st to 5th mission. Scenarios can be repeated, and taken in any order. 
 (Although it may be impossible to complete if the party is too weak.) A party 
 must first be organized.

ADVANCE TIME: Passes one year.

VIEW PARTY: View the status of party members. A party must first be organized.

VIEW CHARACTER: Same as VIEW PARTY but works with disbanded members instead.

ORGANIZE PARTY: Choose up to four members to be in a party. A member must be 
 fully equipped in order to join. Some scenarios only allow parties with up to 
 3 members, because you will be joined by an NPC.

CREATE CHARACTER: Begin character generation process. (See below.)
 The maximum number of characters is 10.

DISBAND PARTY: Un-organizes a party, if one exists.

REMOVE CHARACTER: Permanently deletes a character.

GO TO TOWN: Characters can do business in town. The party must be disbanded.

CHANGE OCCUPATION: Choose a different job for a character, which determines the 
 annual income, exp, and stat modifications. The available jobs depend on the 
 class, age, and sex of the character.

SAVE CHARACTERS: Save the state of all characters to one of slots from 1-9.
 The save files are created in the directory ./USER/ and are named SAVE# where 
 # is 0-9. There is a sample set of characters provided in slot 0, which can't 
 be overwritten. Of course, you can copy, rename and remove save files through 
 your filesystem.

LOAD CHARACTERS: Load character state from one of 10 slots from 0-9.

QUIT (CTRL-Q)

FIGHT DRAGON: Starts a mini-scenario in which you must fight some powerful 
 dragons. This option only appears if all members of the organized party have 
 completed all 5 scenarios of one of the mission suites.

   The dragons can deal damage extremely fast and can take a lot of damage in 
 return. The dragons you fight are:
 -pair of Hydras (from 1-1. THE STOLEN SCEPTER)  
 -Blue Dragon (from 2-4. THE DARK MAGICIAN)
 -Vadis (from 2-2. THE DRAGON KING; remember to attack tail-first)
 -a unique Red Dragon

   Some of your abilities are disabled for this scenario. You cannot:
 -Sprint (shift key)
 -See monster info (M key)
 -See inventory (I key)
 -Save or Load
 -Leave the level

   The only way to leave is to win, and there is no exp or treasure reward.


  3. CHARACTER GENERATION

  After entering a name, you need to choose a race and sex; These determine the 
initial stats of the character:

     Fighter       |  Wizard        |  Dwarf         |  Elf           
     Male  Female  |  Male  Female  |  Male  Female  |  Male  Female  
STR     8     7    |    -3    -4    |    10     9    |     0    -1    
INT     0     0    |    10     9    |   -10    -9    |     4     5    
PRT     9     8    |     6     5    |    10     9    |     7     6    
MGR     4     5    |     9    10    |     7     8    |     6     7    
VIT     8     7    |     5     5    |    10     9    |     6     5    
DEX     4     5    |     5     6    |     8     9    |     7     7    
KRM     2     3    |     3     4    |     2     2    |     5     6    

  Characters get a random number of bonus points from 3-5. Select a stat and 
deduct points with Space and increase with Enter. To discourage excessively 
specialized characters, reducing a stat below its initial value costs two 
points per single bonus point yielded. Stats cannot be reduced beyond 0 or 
increased beyond 10, which is the maximum for level 0 characters.
  Bonus points can also be gained by aging the character; each increment yields 
one point. (See the below table on Age for information on increments.) Aging a 
character should be considered a handicap, as stats can be gained faster (in 
game years) by training. The initial stats are largely trivial for this reason.
  More important is the racial makeup of the party. Fighters and Wizards live 
the shortest but level the fastest, while the opposite is true of Elves. (See 
section below.) Further, the Fighters and Dwarves equip weapons, armor and 
shields, while Wizards and Elves wear staffs, robes and rings. This is 
important because the treasures found in the scenarios can only be used by some 
characters.
  All characters start with no items, at level 0 with 0 exp and 50 gold.


  4. CHARACTER PARAMETERS

HP  Determines how much damage a character can take. In scenarios, HP can be 
    regenerated by standing still and not using weapons or magic for awhile.
MP  All spells except the version of Flame on the Wooden Cane cost MP to cast. 
    When not full, MP constantly regenerates. Max HP and MP depend on level.

STR (Strength) Determines weapon damage;
    characters with STR 0 or less cannot swing weapons
INT (Intelligence) Determines magic damage;
    characters with INT 0 or less cannot use magic
PRT (Protection) Reduces damage from physical attacks
MGR (Magic resistance) Reduces damage from magic attacks
VIT (Vitality) Required to open doors; only the party leader needs it
DEX (Dexterity) Helps avoid traps; only the party leader needs it;
    Not necessary with Traps knowledge.
KRM (Karma) Reduces exp required for level-up; lowers cost of goods and 
    services in town; reduces time required to enchant items with magic; 
    determines disposition of store owners; decreases annual income; plays a 
    role in whether the character can be resurrected at the Temple
MAX (Maximum) Determines how high stats can go. The negative of MAX is the 
    minimum value. Enchantments can bring the stats above the maximum.
    MAX depends on level.

Scenario number    Required VIT to open doors
1                   5
2                  10
3                  15
4                  20
5                  25

Character's KRM    Alignment    Enchantment time     Proprietor's appearance
16 and above       "Good"       1 year               Beaming with eyes closed
-15 to 15          "Neutral"    3 years              Ordinary
-16 and below      "Evil"       5 years              Strongly displeased

Level: Level determines the character's max HP and MP, and the MAX stats.

  Max HP = 200 x level, except for 100 HP at level 0
  Max MP = 25 x (2 + level) up to 250 at level 8
  MAX stats = 5 x (2 + level) up to 50 at level 8

The exp required to reach the next level is:

  exp = N x (1 + current level) x (100 - KRM)

where is N is 2 for Fighters and Wizards, 3 for Dwarves, and 6 for Elves.
  Note that level-ups do not occur automatically, but must be recieved from the 
Throne Room in town. The exp needed to level up is deducted from the amount 
shown in the status screen when the level-up occurs. This means that the shown 
exp is less than the total earned exp.

Knowledge: There are four Knowledge skills learned at the Training field.
  Items: The character can Appraise items found in scenarios.
  Traps: The character defeats all traps when leading the party.
  Monsters: Get information on monsters with the M key when leading the party.
  Herbs: If the character uses a potion and has the herbs necessary to make 
    another potion of the same type, then the herbs are spent and another 
    potion is created. This makes it possible to use potions multiple times.

-Characters can learn more than one of the Knowledge skills.
-Getting hit by a Memory Loss trap causes all Knowledge to be lost.

The inventory is arranged like this:

Item no.  Type                   Color
1         Arm or Staff           Bright
2         Armor or Robe          Bright
3         Shield or Ring         Bright
4         Potion                 Bright
5         Equipment or potion    Dim
6         Equipment or potion    Dim

  The bright colored items are active (equipped). In scenarios, they can be 
used to cast magic and affect stats if they are enchanted. To equip a backup 
item, select the equipped item of the same type and press Enter. Press Enter 
over the item to drink it or make it activate its magic, when the magic button 
is pressed in combat. You can also choose to use no magic.
  Note that using potions gives the benefit to the entire party. However, items 
and gold cannot be passed between characters.

Age chart:
                  Increment     Young    Middle-aged     Old
Fighter/Wizard            2     16-39          40-59     60+
Dwarf                     4     16-59          60-99    100+
Elf                       9     16-99        100-199    200+

  Characters start at age 16 (or higher, if you choose) and naturally get older 
as time passes. The races have different life spans and enter middle and old 
age at different times. The races are also aged by different amounts if you 
wish to gain additional stat points during character generation. (This is the 
increment.) Age is responsible for the character portait and affects which jobs 
can be taken. Old characters lose one point per year in a random stat, and have 
a random chance of permanently dying each year.
  If an old character passes away, you have the option of creating a replace-
ment character of the same race but either sex. This new character has all of 
the belongings and even stats of the deceased, but starts at level 0 with 0 exp 
and thus is limited to MAX 10. Presumably the replacement is a descendant.
  Age can be reversed: The Rejuvenate spell, which costs 200 MP, reduces the 
age of the party leader by 1 year, and stats by 3, for each casting. 
  There is also a way to achieve immortality, in which the character's age 
never increases, stats don't atrophy due to old age, and spontaneous death 
never occurs. (See the Magician entry in the Town Menu section.) Due to the 
stat penalty for Rejuvenation, it really should not be used except on immortal 
characters.

  At the bottom is the character's Occupation. The available jobs depend on 
race, sex, age and stats. Every year spent working causes a character to 
undergo changes to the stats (within the bounds MAX) and gain a specific amount 
of exp and annual income. (See section below for details.) These things occur 
only when the character is not organized in a party and not in the midst of 
training. For example, if a character sells off his equipment at the end of a 
scenario (which would cause him to be disbanded), or is completing the second 
year of training, the annual changes do apply.
  If with the passage of time a character no longer qualifies for a job (e.g., 
due to aging) he will be "dismissed" (fired) and reverts to Farmer.
  Jobs are mostly just for gradually raising stats, but in one mission, 2-2, 
certain jobs are required complete the objectives.


  5. CHARACTER OCCUPATIONS

Adapted from: http://homepage2.nifty.com/tkdate/Pc88_98/job/job1.html

  This table lists each job along with the allowed races, ages and sexes that 
can take the job. The first row of stats show what the required stats are to 
take the job. The second row shows the changes that occur to the stats each 
year, along with annual income and exp earned.
  Note that all jobs offer an annual net gain of 1 point to stats. Annual 
income given is for a character with 0 KRM. Higher KRM will DECREASE the income.

  6. TOWN MENU

WEAPON SHOP: Here you can buy basic equipment. There is no selection--only the 
 basic goods are available. Fighters and Dwarves take a weapon, armor and 
 shield while Wizards and Elves take a rod, robe and ring.
   However, it should be noted that the Wizard and Elf equipment can cast 
 spells, even though they are unenchanted. Enchanting these goods will cause 
 the free spell to disappear.

Wooden Cane    Special weak version of Flame which costs no MP to cast
Cotton Robe    Shield
Crystal Ring   Heal

MAGICIAN

ENCHANT THIS ITEM: You can imbue your equipment with magic of any of the 7 gods.
 The purpose is to increase the wearer's stats and to impart magic spells. 
 The boost to the stats takes place immediately, but imbuing the spell takes a 
 number of years. (See KRM discussion above.) Each character can only have one 
 piece worked on at a time.

 The base cost of enchantment, prior to KRM adjustment, is:

     Cost in gold = 10 x (1 + Sum of existing enchantments)

   Wearing an enchanted item increases your stats, and it is possible to go 
 beyond the maximum in this way. (However, the effect only takes place during 
 scenarios, which means that KRM bonuses cannot be exploited.) Each god 
 increases a particular stat, (see the Elder section for details) and the item 
 can be enchanted multiple times by the same god, but complications arise when 
 one or more gods are present on the item when it is enchanted.
   No interference: There is no heterogenous enchantment on the item. This 
 includes the case of an unenchanted item. The result is simply to add +1 to 
 the god in question.
   Single interference: There is one heterogenous enchantment. Most combina-
 tions give the ordinary result (indicated by the . in the tables below), but 
 some have unusual effects. The following two tables are equivalent; the top 
 shows changes made to the initial state (indicated by + and -) while the 
 bottom instead shows the final state, assuming the initial state had 1 level 
 of the prior god. An X indicates a loss of the prior god with no gain.

(Prior enchantment is vertical on the left, added is horizontal on the top.)

    Multiple inferference: There is more than one heterogenous enchantment. 
  These are handled on a case by case basis in the table below. This assumes 
  you are starting with 1 each of the prior enchantments. Note that the table 
  can be partially predicted by superposing the results from multiple single 
  interference enchantments. (i.e. regard them as simultaneous)

   As for maximum enchantment, the limit seems to be 3 for any god if done 
 directly and 5 if done indirectly (via single or double interference). 
 However, many treasures can be found with initial levels above these limits.

Examples:
Prior enchantment:     Magician adds:                Result:    Net:
         (nothing)                 +X                     X1      +1
                X3                 +X                     X3       0
               Ma1             +Venus                Ma1 Ve1      +1
               Me1             +Venus              (nothing)      -1
               Su2           +Mercury            Me1 Su1 Ve1      +1
           Ma3 Ju3           +Jupiter                Ma2 Ju5      +1
       Me3 Ju3 Ve4              +Mars    Ma1 Me2 Ju3 Ve3 Sa2      +1

   Here is a more involved example, starting from scratch and producing a 
Dragon Slayer item:

Add:     Result:
Ma x3    Ma3 .   .   .   .   .   .
Su x3    .   .   .   .   Su5 .   .
Ma x3    Ma3 .   .   .   Su5 .   .
Mo x3    Ma3 .   .   Mo3 Su5 .   .
Sa x3    Ma3 .   .   Mo3 Su5 .   Sa3
Me x3    Ma3 Me3 .   Mo3 Su2 Ve3 Sa3
Ju x1    Ma2 Me3 Ju2 Mo4 Su2 Ve2 Sa3

It's possible to keep going from there, but you get the idea.

REMOVE A SPELL: Cures a curse, same as Un-curse potion.

RESURRECT THE DEAD: Raises a dead character for a fee. Another character must 
 do this on the dead one's behalf. This costs a fee, which depends of the 
 deceased character's age, level, and time dead, and is unaffected by KRM.
   The resurrection has a chance of failure, which increases as the years go by 
 and also depends on the age of the deceased, with young characters having the 
 best outlook, and Old the worst.

Tables adapted from: http://homepage2.nifty.com/tkdate/Pc88_98/town/esther.html

                  Chance of resurrection
Years dead   YOUNG      MIDDLE-AGED  OLD

4-9          90%        80%          50%
10-19        80%        60%          20%
20-29        70%        30%          10%

   Failure to resurrect obliterates the character. Successful revival, on the 
 other hand, confers various side effects depending on the age and time dead.

20-29        Max HP -20%       Age -10 years     Immortality

   Immortality means the character will no longer increase in age and will not 
 perish from old age. The age can still be decreased by the Rejuvenate spell.

GIVE ME BACK ITEM: Takes back the item being enchanted. If you interrupt the 
 process before it's done the god's bonus still remains--in other words, that 
 part is added instantly. The spell, however, will not be ready. Instead it 
 will be present as a locked spell.


HERBALIST SHOP

PLEASE PREPARE THESE HERBS: Select herbs in the character's inventory with 
 which to make a potion. See the CHARTS section for all formulas.

I WANT TO BUY A POTION: Buy a premade potion. The pre-KRM costs are:
Heal          20
Resurrect     50
Cure          20
Melt          20

TEMPLE

Adapted from: http://homepage2.nifty.com/tkdate/Pc88_98/town/temple.html

I WANT TO MAKE A CONFESSION and I WILL DONATE 20 GOLD
   Doing both in one year will raise KRM by 1 point, but only if it is negative.
 This only works once per year.

I WANT TO PRAY
   This affects a character's ability to resurrect a dead comrade with the 
 option below. A character's prayer count is tracked in the save file; Praying 
 more than once a year offers no additional benefit. 

RESURRECT THE DEAD
   This option can raise a dead member with no chance of failure and no side 
 effects. However, certain conditions, which are not entirely known at this 
 time, must be met. Aside from the supplicant's prayer count, the KRM of 
 deceased also plays an apparent role.


ELDER'S HOUSE: The Elder will appraise any piece of equipment (not potions) for 
 a fee. The cost is the same as what the magician charges for enchantments. 
 This tells you the enchantment level for each of the seven gods and what 
 spell effect it has, if any, when equipped.  Although the Elder correctly 
 identifies the gods, he mixes up most of the bonus effects that the gods give:

Enchantment    Bonus (Elder)    Bonus (actual)
Mars               INT              STR
Mercury            STR              INT
Jupiter            MGR              PRT
Moon               PRT              MGR
Sun                DEX              VIT
Venus              VIT              DEX
Saturn             KRM              KRM

   If there is a locked spell on the item the Elder offers to release it, for a 
 high price.
   The elder will also offer a magic formula as part of the deal.
 See the CHARTS section for all formulas.

 make it happen. The king also informs you how many exp you need to advance to 
 the next level.

  7. TIPS FOR BEGINNERS
General:
-Since you control the stats, you can make a strong party out of any combin-
ation of characters, even 4 of the same race.
-To get started quickly, use the prefab party. (load slot 0)
-If the battles are too hard, train.
-If the battles are too easy, stop training.
-KRM is good to raise early for elves since it speeds up the leveling process.
-Give characters healing, restoration, and resurrection items to avoid trouble 
later. Potions are good; Spells on your equipment is better.
-Since one inventory slot is reserved exclusively for potions, there's no 
reason not to carry at least one potion.
-Do not feel the need to put Dragon Slayer on every item. (It's not as good as 
you think.) Most treasures found in the scenarios have good spells on them.
-An inexpensive way to unlock latent spells is to apply a single enchantment 
(one that doesn't change the configuration of the gods) and wait for the 
enchantment to finish.

Tactics:
-If you can, use a gamepad. Even better, bind the keyboard keys to the gamepad.
-Change character order as needed. You will want to put different characters 
 in front depending on the situation. Your Trap man should be the one opening 
 doors, for example.
-The sprint key (Shift) is of extreme importance. Use it to save time, escape 
 monsters, make difficult jumps easier, and keep up with fast-moving bosses.
-Bosses tend to be magic resistant. Therefore it's wise to some bring characters
 who are good with weapons.
-On the other hand magic is very convenient for defense, support, and dealing 
 with regular monsters. In particular, the Flame spell on the Wooden Cane can 
 dispatch monsters on the early levels easily.
-Characters with the most HP should be the the damage buffers for the weaker 
 characters. As such, one should go in the front and another, to a lesser 
 extent, should go in the back because these are the most vulnerable positions.
-Defensive spells with a fixed radius work best if the caster is in the second 
 position.
-In order to win exp for fighting regular monsters, you have to keep fighting 
 until all in the area are dead. This may be impossible if new monsters are 
 showing up faster than you can kill them.
-Save and load the game with F5 and F7. Each scenario has one save slot in the 
 ./USER/ directory named SV##0, where the first # is the mission suite number 
 minus 1 and the second # is the scenario number minus 1. As with the Main Menu 
 saves, you can always manage these files from outside the game.

Treasure hunting:
-Monsters do not give good rewards for killing them. Thus it is often best to 
 avoid fighting. Do not underestimate the value of defensive spells for this 
 reason.
-Some sites need to be persistently searched to yield treasure.
-Much of the useful treasure (namely equipment) won't show up until the main 
 objective is completed. Search for it before leaving the level.
-A rapid method for accumulating gold is to load up on items in town, enter 
 a scenario, find at least one treasure, leave and sell everything (see below).

End of level process: (Saving before leaving the level is recommended, in case 
you make a mistake in the following procedures.)

-First, if you have an item that can be given to the king as Tribute, you 
choose whether to give it. Some Tribute items are useful (to you) as equipment.
-Each character is awarded the exp you earned during the level.
-You get a gold bonus, 1/10 of the exp, which is added to the gold pool.
-If you found at least one item you can DIVIDE/SELL/APPRAISE the item(s).

DIVIDE: Gives the item to one of the members. Tools (items with no use) cannot 
 be divided. Items cannot be given to characters who can't use or carry them. 
 If more than one character can take items, they will be given first to the 
 member closest to the front of the party. (You can control this by choosing 
 the order in which you Divide them.)
SELL: Sells the item. The price is 5 x (1 + sum of enchantments), which is 
 quite low, and yields only 5 gold for tools.
APPRAISE: A character with Items Knowledge can determine what use, enchantments 
 and spell the item has. This is the same as the identification function that 
 the Elder performs in town, but it costs nothing and can only be done during 
 this phase. You cannot unlock latent spells with this skill.
Sell personal items: You can also sell items of individual members. The sell 
 price in this case is enormous, particularly for armor. This is by far the 
 fastest way to get money. The gold from these personal sales goes directly to 
 the character who sold the item, not the pool.

-The proceeds from any sold treasures go into the gold pool.
-When everything is finished, the gold is distributed among the characters.
-Any treasure that is not divided or sold is forfeited.


  8. SAVE HACKING

  Not quite hacking. You are limited to viewing only due to the implementation 
of an anti-tampering checksum at the end of the save file. You will not be able 
to load the edited save file unless you also generate the matching checksum. 
Nevertheless, the save file is a valuable source of information. The offsets 
below correspond to the character in the first position of the non-party 
roster; the party roster is at the front of the file.

Parameter            Offset

Max MP               0x0405
Max stat limit       0x0406

II. WALKTHROUGH

  CONVENTIONS

*    Entrance and exit of the level
___  Floors
|    Vertical walls, stairs, ropes, waterways etc. Two-way travel is possible.
^    Indicates a one-way drop.
[00] Rectangular door; Match up the numbers to see what leads where.
(00) Roundish hole in the wall; Functions as door. Some holes are small.
<00> One-way travel that leads to >00<
>00< One-way travel that leads from <00> and cannot be entered
-    Links adjacent areas. (Only used in scenario 5.)

H    Hyssop
L    Lavender
G    Sage
S    Savory
V    Verbena
?    Random herb(s)

  The numbering of the doors is the order you can follow to get from beginning 
to end; however, since some levels do not require you to pass through every 
door, and many doors need to be passed through more than once, and there is 
more than one route through most scenarios, this is clearly not intended to be 
a rigid order. More important is the sequence of events, because triggers, such 
as throwing a switch, will need to be activated before other triggers become 
available. It is not possible to get stuck--for example by using up a tool or 
forgetting to pick one up, or going out of the order that the guide says. 
There's always a way to proceed. The only way to really get stuck is by losing 
an important character (e.g. your boss-killer or door opener)
  Every scenario has at least two objectives; these will be the chief exp 
earners for your characters. Since you can usually leave the level whenever 
you want, it's up to you (and the preparation of your characters) how many you 
want to do.
  There will be no mention of monsters and no discussion on fighting bosses. 
Some bosses require special procedures, which are always mentioned as part of 
the story.

  There are no plans to make maps for the other scenarios, because I have 
found full-color, animated maps at:
http://homepage2.nifty.com/tkdate/Pc88_98/scenario/scenario.html
This site also deserves credit for the location of most of the hidden treasures.

these doors leads to a Crystal Valve. You need to retrieve your fork each time

-Now arrange the valves in the heart so the left one is placed but the right 
one is removed.
-Place the fork in the room with the yellow ornament (clear tone). The door to 
the last valve is unlocked if you did this and arranged the valves correctly.
-Get the last valve and bring it back to the heart. Make only the middle slot 
occupied. This opens the path to the water but closes some holes.
-Treasure is now available: Check the far side of the acid lake for the Gladius.
-You will need to get to the Water of Life room by way of the clear tone door.
-Once you have the water, a Potion is available where the cask is.
-Remove all the valves from the heart to lower a barrier blocking the exit.

  1. "MAGIC"

                                  INTRODUCTION

In this book are written the secret principles which have been handed down from
generation to generation in our Sorcerian household.As you hold this book in
your hands,remember that you are a descendant of the Sorcerians.

In times long past, the Sorcerians servedthe Gods of the seven planets and
controlled many magical powers. In those times we lived among the Gods and never
died. We were almost like gods ourselves.

Long ages ago, as mortals count time, evil beings who opposed the will of Heaven
escaped from captivity and came to make their home among the people of the earth
At that time we acquired a new purpose; our ancestors were sent to earth by the
Gods to annihilate the evil ones.

But the earth is not like Heaven. Here the flame of life burns quickly,and they
realized it would be impossible to destroy the evil in one generation. Thus the
Sorcerians established themselves on earth as mortal beings and handed down 
their sacred purpose from generation to generation.

When you have read this book, you who have inherited our blood must make a
decision; deny your Sorcerian heritage and live as normal mortals, or become a
Sorcerian adventurer, striving to achieve your ancestors' purpose and doing all
you can to destroy the evil forces of the five elements that will array them-
selves against you.

The evil ones use powerful magic and the once-godlike Sorcerians are now only
humans whose power is limited. Therefore you must learn the secrets of magic 
which have been handed down through the generations.

Even though you are a Sorcerian, magic is not easy to control.It is a demanding
art which taxes your whole body, mind and spirit. You should realize that unless
your entire being has been trained, you will accomplish little but an early 
death. Many techniques of might and magic must be perfected by the true ad-
venturer if the adventure is to achieve its purpose.

Before you embark on an adventure, choose companions whose desires and goals are
like yours, and who are likewise trained in the disciplines of body, mind and 
spirit. When you have such a group, united in determination and purpose, go     
forth and battle the powers of evil as we have been ordained to do. And may the
protection of the Gods go with you.




                        
                        THE GODS OF THE SEVEN PLANETS
                        


THE SUN

The Sun, as the source of all life, controls the power of life, vitality,
creativity, and regeneration.

Sun magic is the power of creation. When combined with Mars, it is destruction.
Sun magic also gives strength and vitality.

THE MOON

As the moon drives away darkness, her magic has power over beings of the dark. 
As she reflects the light of the Sun, her magic also reflects other magics. As
she controls the tides,so does her magic control the element of water. 

Moon magic gives resistance against magic spells.

MERCURY

Mercury is the God in charge of intelligence, language and communication.He is
also the God of speed and movement, and controlsthe power of the wind.

Mercury magic bestows intelligence and the power of magical offense.

VENUS

Venusis the Goddess of harmony, balance and peace.Hers is the power to avoid
confrontation.

Venus magic is essential for any sort of purification.She can unite the warring
powers of other gods, and bestow dexterity.

MARS

Mars is the God of battle, destruction and fire. Mars magic has the ability to
combine the magic of other Gods into a strong destructive force.

Mars' power is the power of offense.

JUPITER

Jupiter is the God of justice, wisdom and luck.His power is second only to the 
Sun,and grows stronger when combined with sun Magic.

Jupiter magic gives the power of healing and revival, and increases vitality.

SATURN

Saturn is the God of darkness,destruction and death.He controls the forces of
the earth.

Saturn magic is an important offensive force



                        
                        MONSTERS OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS
                        
The elements which make up all life on Earth and in Heaven are earth, fire,
water, AIR and spirit. All enemies you will enconter have their being in
one of these elements.

EARTH ELEMENT MONSTERS

Every mortal thing that walks or crawls on the ground belongs to the earth
element. This includes humans and humanoid monsters. Ground-dwelling animals
also belong to this element.

FIRE ELEMENT MONSTERS

Those creatures born from heat and flame belong to the fire element. They
frequently resemble fire in some way. Fire element monsters dislike water in
any form.

WATER ELEMENT MONSTERS

Anything made of liquid, jelly or slime belongs to the water element. Monsters
which inhabit the water are also water element creatures. All such creatures
hate fire.

AIR ELEMENT MONSTERS

Creatures that fly upon the wind belong to the air element. Most air element
monsters are invisible, but may attack by means of wind, such as a tornado.

SPIRIT ELEMENT MONSTERS

Spirits and other non-physical cretures belong to the spirit element. Skeletons
and Mummies are also sky creatures, since they have no real physical existence
in our world.

                      
                      ON THE EFFECTS AND USES OF MAGIC.
                      
The magics available to you can be made into 120 different spells, by combining
the powers of the seven planets. The full knowledge of this cannot be written 
here, for fear of this book falling into the wrong hands. However, here are
three keys to guide you in your study of the uses of magic:

                                 THE FIRST KEY
                                 
Magic may be locked into an item, such as a weapon or some other personal item.
A person versed in enchantments can perform this task, granting powers to your
possessions.

The powers of the seven Gods combine in different ways, and not all of the Gods 
work well together, so care must be taken in combining the powers of the planets

Magic can also be infused into potions made from the five sacred herbs. An 
herbalist knows how to prepare herbs properly to bring out their magic powers.

                                THE SECOND KEY
                                
Since all magic is granted by the seven Gods, magic spells are characterized by
those things governed by the Gods whose magic is being called upon. Some magics
will be more effective than others against certain enemies, because of the 
nature of the enemy and the nature of the magic. The character of the enemy can
be known by knowing its origins; the character of the magic can be known by
observing its effects.

Great care must be taken not to use the magic of one element against a creature
of that same element, for fear of strengthening your enemy rather than 
weakening it.

                                THE THIRD KEY
                                
The strongest and most powerful magics are those which partake of the powers of 
the most Gods. These are the best magics for defeating enemies of the spirit
element.

                           
                            THE FIVE SACRED HERBS

sometimes found growing in ruins and deserted places.

medicine. It is often found in the woods.

SAGE

Sage hasthe power to neutralize poisons. It grows mostly in the desert.

and spirit. It grows in the high mountains.

of marshes.



  2. "HERBS"
                                Herbal Potions
                                
Herbs show their power only when made into potions by one who knows this art. An
herbalist is specially trained to prepare these potions.

  I am indebted to the authors of this website, where I found a tremendous 
amount of information on the game mechanics and hidden treasures in the 
scenarios. Refer to the citations in the text to find what information was 
borrowed in the making of this FAQ.

  Also I owe "greybeard" for uploading the charts to the now-defunct HOTU.

  Aside from the citations given from the aforementioned website, and the text 
files from the manual given in section III, this document is my own work. Any 
questions, comments, corrections or complaints should be addressed to the 
address below, with clear indication in the subject line that the email is 
concerning this FAQ. 
  Given that I prefer to write for obscure titles, I enjoy hearing from people 
who read my guides. If you've played the game and used the FAQ, feel free to 
drop me a line and tell me what you think.
