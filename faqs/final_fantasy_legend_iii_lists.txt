--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. ATTACK PROPERTIES

Every attack, whether physical, magical or talent, can have a property (no more 
than one) that may affect its damage or inflict status ailments.

  1. ELEMENTALS
There are four elementals: Fire, Ice, Tornado and Quake. The Thunder elemental 
is a combination of Ice and Tornado.

A character or monster may be weak, strong, or neither against each of these, 
depending on the talents and equipped armor. If the target is strong against a 
certain elemental attack or spell, the attack is performed with half skill, and 
if the target is weak, with double skill.

The OChange trait resists all elementals.

  2. STATUS CONDITIONS
Good: Normal status condition

Mute: Target cannot cast spells.
Confuse: Target takes random actions against random targets.
Blind: Hit rate is reduced.
Sleep: Target cannot act. Wears off over time.
Paralysis (Para): Target cannot act.
Curse: Target is reduced to half defense and half magic defense.
Petrify (Stone): Target character cannot act; persists after battle.
                 Target monster dies.
Fatal: Target is instantly killed and becomes Fell. 
Fell: Target lost all HP and is killed. Persists after battle.

Characters and enemies may be immune to certain status effects based on their 
armor and talents. The OAll trait makes the subject immune to all of the above 
problems, except Fell.

If an attack would have caused an ailment but the target is immune, the message 
"No effect." will be reported.

  3. OTHERS
If the target has the ODamage talent, any attack that has the Damage property, 
which includes most weapons and a few talents, does half damage. There is no 
advantage to having this property. Toward the end game many opponents have 
ODamage so it's important to have alternative attacks that have other traits or 
at least don't have the Damage property.

The Drain property causes the attacker to be healed by a random amount if the 
attack is successful.

Holy weapons do double damage against undead targets. Undead are defined as 
enemies that take damage from healing spells or items.

The Mystic property, named for the Mystic swords, causes double damage against 
bosses and undead enemies.

Some attacks have no apparent property. These attacks have no special effects 
or weaknesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. WEAPONS

There are four fundamentally different types of weapons, each of which does 
damage by a different formula. Any class can equip any weapon, but some classes 
use some weapons better than others.

  1. MELEE WEAPONS
Melee weapons do damage based on the wielder's attack and agility and the 
weapon's power. All are used with double skill by humans.

Damage = skill x (WP + Att. + Agi.) - Def.

Skill        Monster Beast Mutant  Human Cyborg  Robot
Normal          -      1      1*     2      1      1
Mystic swords   -      2      2      2      2      2

* Mutants wield the following with skill 2 instead of skill 1:
Psi knife, Psi sword, X-Fire staff, Fast staff

  2. MISSILE WEAPONS
Missile weapons do damage based on the wielder's attack and weapon power. Humans
use throwing weapons with double skill.

Damage = skill x (WP + 2 x Att.) - Def.

  3. MARTIAL ARTS
Martial arts do damage based on attack and weapon power. Beasts use martial arts
with 50% more skill than other classes.

Damage = 1/2 x skill x WP x Att. - Def.

  4. FIXED DAMAGE WEAPONS
Fixed damage weapons do damage independent of the user's stats. All classes use 
these weapons with equal skill, except humans use Cripplers with double skill.

Damage = skill x WP - Def.

Skill        Monster Beast Mutant  Human Cyborg  Robot
Cripplers       -      4      4      8      4      4
Guns            -      4      4**    4**    4      4
Others          -      8      8      8      8      8

** Mutants get a damage bonus equal to 2x Magic with the Psi gun. Humans and 
mutants use the Poison gun at skill 8.

If targeting a group, damage is divided by the number of enemies in the group.
Targeting single or all enemies does full damage.

Cripplers reduce the target's attack, defense, agility or magic by 10. The 
stat seems to depend on the species and the crippler used.

Bombs, Cannons, and most Guns can target either a single enemy or a group of 
enemies, and multibombs attack all enemies.

Bombs, Cannons, and Multibombs can only be used once per item. If multiple 
items are in inventory, all will be equipped at once.

IV. MAGIC

  1. ATTACK MAGIC
Attack magic is used only in combat, and targeted only at enemies. It does 
damage based on the caster's Magic and the spell power. Mutants cast with double
skill.

Damage = skill x (SP + Mag.) - M.Def.

  2. SUPPORT MAGIC
Support magic is any magic used in combat that doesn't do damage based on the 
Magic stat. The Exit spells, healing spells, and spells that can cure Stone and 
Fell may also be used outside combat. Most support spells can target either 
Allies or Enemies, having curative effects on friends and detrimental effects on
foes. All are cast at single targets, except for CureA, CureB and Exit2.

Cure1     400    8   E/A   Recovers 30% of HP / attacks undead

  3. TRAVEL MAGIC

Float       -    0   Allows travel over water
Dive        -    0   Allows travel over water and to the seafloor
Morph       -   16   Disguises party as WaterHags or Dwelgs

  4. ITEM MAGIC
Item magic is cast by using certain equipment from the Item menu in battle. The 
item must be unequipped. Unlike weapons like bombs, these items can be used 
endlessly, and can even be used by multiple characters in the same round. Unlike
attack magic, item magic can miss and count as a mighty blow. Item spells can 
only target single enemies.

They do damage based on the spell power and the user's Magic. The item's spell 
power is the same as the SP of the attack magic they cast. All classes use item 
magic with equal skill.

Damage = skill x (SP + Mag.) - M.Def.

V. TALENTS

Every species outside of the humans/mutant classes has innate abilities called 
talents. In this game the available talents depend only on the species and don't
change unless species changes.

Some talents are selected as the action in combat, and some are passive and 
cannot be selected. A few talents can be used actively but also automatically 
counterattack when the creature is hit by a physical attack. Talents are used 
at half power as counterattacks.

Talent damage depends on the user's Attack and maximum HP, the talent power and 
base damage, and a skill factor. Robot talents are used with 50% more skill by 
robots.

Damage = skill x (1/4 x TP x (Att. + maxHP/10) + base) - Def.

Skill        Monster Beast Mutant  Human Cyborg  Robot
Robot talents   1      1     (1)    (1)     1      1.5
Other talents   1      1     (1)    (1)     1      1

Except for the Remedy(1) and Remedy(2), all active talents are directed at 
enemies. If targeting a group, damage is divided by the number of enemies in the
group. Targeting single or all enemies does full damage. This is the same as 
with weapons and magic.

M.Evade: Increases the chance that the opponent's magic attack will miss.

  2. CYBORG UPGRADES
Cyborgs depend on equipment for most of their stats. In addition to the same 
benefits that other classes get from equipment, cyborgs also get bonuses that 
depend on the type and strength of the equipment. The primary stats are raised 
by the amounts given in sections I and II. The secondary stats are raised by 
1/10 the primary stat bonus.

Equipped item       Raises stats
                 Primary   Secondary
Weapon, Shield   max HP    Attack
Helmet, Armor    max HP    Defense
Gloves, Shoes    max MP    Agility
Others, Others   max MP    Magic

  3. ROBOT UPGRADES
Robots depend on capsules for most of their upgrades. Capsules are available 
from some item stores. Robot upgrades are permanent, but are only applied when 
the character is in robot form. The benefits cannot be transferred to other 
characters. The maximum bonus that a robot can get from capsules is 999 for HP 
and 99 for Attack, Defense and Agility. This is added to the robot's base stats 
and the equipment effects to give the final stats.

Capsule   Cost   Effect         Bought
Attack    1500   +3 Attack      Dharm (Present); Elan (Past, Future);
                                Cirrus, Donmac, Knaya (Pureland)
Defense   1500   +3 Defense     Elan (Present); Lae (Past); Viper City (Future);
                                Knaya, Porle (Pureland)
Speed     1500   +3 Agility     Elan (Present), Lae (Past), Viper City (Future);
                                Knaya, Porle (Pureland)
HP        1500   +24-40 max HP  Dharm (Present); Elan (Past, Future);
                                Cirrus, Donmac, Knaya (Pureland)

On average, an HP capsule contributes as much as an Attack capsule toward the 
robot's talent damage output, in addition to improving its survivability.

VII. CLASSES

Some general advice on choosing classes:
* Rather than designating each character as particular class, instead examine 
the available species and select the one with the best talents or stats. Some 
species are better than others of the same level.
* The exception to the above is robots, because they are too costly to develop
without focusing.
* Species with instant kill or debilitating talents are excellent for fighting
regular enemies.
* Species that have uninteresting talents may make up for it with high stats.
* Non-attack magic is effective cast by any class, not just Mutants.
* Stats can exceed 999 & 99, but will not be displayed any higher on the menus.

  1. MONSTERS
Monsters are identical to their enemy counterparts, but can also use magic. They
are useful when money is short, because they are fully functional with no 
equipment. The drawback is they get no defensive benefit from armor and can't 
use weapons in battle. (They can still hold the equipment though.) Due to their 
high stats, they make good healers and meat shields.

    + Fully powered with no investment
    + Can use talents
    + High overall stats
    - Cannot use weapons, and talents don't hit as hard as weapons
    - No benefit from equipment, and some have elemental weakness
    - No combat specialties

  2. BEASTS
Beasts get a little bit of everything. They can use weapons, talents, and magic 
and are especially good with martial arts. Try to choose a beast with high 
Attack, to maximize martial arts damage.

    + 1.5x damage with martial arts
    + Can use both equipment & talents
    - Medium overall stats

  3. MUTANTS
Mutants are the magic specialists, and are as versatile as their magic 
inventory. Optimize spell damage by targeting the enemy's elemental weaknesses 
and avoiding their strengths. They can do decent weapon damage by using weapons 
with mutant bonuses. Mutants are more useful toward the end of the game, when 
powerful spells and MP-restoring items become available.

    + 2x damage with attack spells
    + Can use equipment
    - Medium overall stats; low HP and attack power
    - Cannot use talents

  4. HUMANS
Humans are very good with weapons, and little else. Humans hit hard, and are 
typically restricted to attacking a single enemy each round. This makes Humans 
optimal for boss battles and weak enemies. Use weapons with an elemental or 
status effect properties when fighting enemies with O-Damage to avoid the damage
resistance. Humans lose their advantage toward the end of the game, when Mystic 
swords become available.

    + 2x damage with most weapons
    + Can use equipment
    - Medium overall stats; low MP and magic power
    - Cannot use talents

  5. CYBORGS
Cyborgs, like beasts, can use weapons, talents, and magic, but have no 
specialties. This can be offset by their high stats. Cyborgs can be good at 
anything if given strong equipment. Cyborgs are best when Mystic swords become 
available.

    + Can use both equipment & talents
    + Highest overall stats if well equipped
    - Requires best available equipment for best results
    - No combat specialties

  6. ROBOTS
The stats of your robots will be greatly atrophied compared to enemy robots. 
However, by consuming capsules, the stats are gradually increased, permanently. 
In this way, robots can be made stronger than any other class. Due to the high, 
but constant, cost of capsules, robot development is easier later in the game. 
The other problem with robots is their inability to use magic.

    + Good damage with Robot talents
    + Can use both equipment & talents
    + Highest non-magic stats if well upgraded
    + Player controls stat growth
    - Requires costly capsules; capsule bonuses are non-transferrable
    - Cannot use magic

** Mutants get a damage bonus equal to 2x Magic with the Psi gun. Humans and 
mutants use the Poison gun at skill 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII. CHANGING CLASS

  1. DETERMINING NEW CLASS
After battle, meat or parts may be left behind, which you may feed to or install
in one of your characters. The basic continuum is:

Monster <=> Beast <=> Human/Mutant <=> Cyborg <=> Robot

Meat transforms the character toward the left, Parts toward the right. Using the
Flushex unit in the restroom of the Talon transforms the characters toward the 
center. Specifically, the changes occur as follows:

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|Current    |Eats meat from:         Installs parts from:    Uses Flushex: |
| class:    |Monster     Beast       Cyborg      Robot                     |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|Monster    |Monster     Beast       Beast       Beast       Beast         |
|Beast      |Monster     Beast       Hum./Mut.   Hum./Mut.   Hum./Mut.     |
|Hum./Mut.  |Beast       Beast       Cyborg      Cyborg      Hum./Mut.     |
|Cyborg     |Hum./Mut.   Hum./Mut.   Cyborg      Robot       Hum./Mut.     |
|Robot      |Cyborg      Cyborg      Cyborg      Robot       Cyborg        |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Reaching monster or robot is more difficult than beast or cyborg because two
pieces of meat or parts are required, and the drop rate is rather low.

Sometimes the character spontaneously changes to another class or species after 
a battle. This can occurs when the character's level is higher than that of the 
current species.

  2. DETERMINING NEW SPECIES
For any experience level, there are four possible monster and beast species, and
two possible cyborg and robot species which the character may become. The 
species depends on the current element of the character and the element of the 
creature being subsumed. This is the only purpose of the intrinsic element; the 
names (Earth, Water, Fire or Air) have no meaning.

+------------+-----------------------------+
|Character's |       Enemy's element:      |
|element:    |Earth   Water    Fire     Air|
+------------+-----------------------------+
|    Earth   |Earth    Fire     Air   Water|
|    Water   |  Air   Water   Earth    Fire|
|     Fire   |Water     Air    Fire   Earth|
|      Air   | Fire   Earth   Water     Air|
+------------+-----------------------------+
The above chart is adapted from the instruction manual.

If a character eats meat or installs parts that would not result in any change
in element, class or level (for example, a beast eating meat of the same species
and level), no transformation occurs. Instead, the character's HP is refilled.

The above charts are adapted from the instruction manual.

Each species has one and only one intrinsic element. The element of each enemy
species is the same as the element under which its name appears. For high-level 
species which appear in more than one column, the element is the same as the 
element of lower-level species of the same type. For example, Garuda is Air 
element, the same element as its lesser cousin Raven. In the case of cyborgs and
robots, the element is always Water or Air.

  3. DETERMINING NEW STATS
The following table shows all of the factors that contribute to a character's 
stats given his or her current class. The percentages show how much of the 
enemy species's base stats are retained.

  2. 5TH CHARACTERS
At certain points a 5th character joins or leaves the party. These characters 
are at a sufficiently high level to make them powerful against the monsters and 
bosses you will be facing. They do not gain exp or level up, and cannot undergo 
class changes. It is possible to give them equipment to fill out the empty 
spaces, but you can't change or remove equipment once placed. You cannot add or 
remove their magic spells. The stats given are base stats, before equipment 
effects.
