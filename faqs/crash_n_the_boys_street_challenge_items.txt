2. Tips

-None of the items at the Inn do any good.

-The <!(&/&X![ item can be a big help but it won't affect opponents you are 
about to face in the current event.

-The TRADE-OFF item may be a good buy if the event doesn't require too much HP.

-The maximum for Power, Defense and Speed is 127.

-Changes to Power, Defense and Speed revert after the event is over, but HP is 
not restored.

-If a character loses all his HP he'll get some back. But the only way to get 
back more is with health food.

-The computer always cheats. However, it never buys items. You won't stand much 
of a chance against the computer unless you buy items.

-The object of the game is to get the most money (medals). So you should only 
make purchases that will pay for themselves.

-GREASER and TACKS are good buys and complement one another well.

-If you don't have autofire you may need the SONIC SPIN.

-An alternative strategy for the Hammer throw is to forget about making Par and 
just get as many coins as possible.

-CHOMPER is unpredictable but often saves the day. WEBBING is definitely worth 
the money.

-RETREAT is very cheap and potentially useful. The important thing is getting 
to the end of the course, not the time.

-SPOOL JOB is the best buy for fighting; even though it's weak, it can drain 
the opponent's PP effectively to set up throws.


3. Hacking

  The following addresses contain important information that could be used for 
making useful codes.

0331-0335  Gold medals of Team 1 - Team 5 (value must be in decimal, not hex)
0336-033A  Silver medals of Team 1 - Team 5 (the only valid values are 00-09)
033B-033F  Bronze medals of Team 1 - Team 5 (the only valid values are 00-09)
0340-0344  Current HP of the five Southside High members (Team 1)
0345-0349  Current HP of the five Washington High members (Team 2)
034A-034E  Current HP of the five Lincoln High members (Team 3)
034F-0353  Current HP of the five Jefferson High members (Team 4)
0354-0358  Current HP of the five Thorney members (Team 5)
06C0-06C4  Speed of active member (Player 1 - Player 5)
06C5-06C9  Power of active member (Player 1 - Player 5)
06CA-06CE  Defense of active member (Player 1 - Player 5)

Example:
000331:40 would set the gold medals of player 1 to 40
000340:FF would set Crash's HP to 255

Note:
The "Current HP" codes fix HP between heats and between events, but you can't 
make characters invincible with them.

The player-team matchups are chosen at the beginning of the game, but "Player 5"
is always the unplayable Thornley team.

Speed, Power and Defense of inactive members are not stored in RAM.
