I. INTRODUCTION

  1. SUMMARY
  Battlemaster is a squad-oriented combat RPG made for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS
PCs and ported to Sega Genesis. It's very easy to get killed and hard to figure
out how to avoid getting killed. This guide completely breaks down the game 
mechanics, while also offering practical survival advice.

  2. FROM THE MANUAL
BATTLEMASTER: The Age of Conflict

Not much is known about the creation of the world. The 
best we have to go on is the ancient book of Atan, passed 
down through thousands of generations, whispering to us 
the secrets of the Legend of Creation. This is its story.

The Four Lords of Creation shaped the world from the 
random dynamics of time and space. This we know, 
thanks to the chronicles written by Aran, the first king and 
potentate of all Magic. It was he who possessed the 
Keystone of Life set deep into a golden crown. With it he 
determined the flux of Magical power. He was the 
chronicler of this world's past, and his chapters are known 
as the Age of Peace.

Just before his death--after all of his kind had died--he 
crafted a final entry into the Book of Aran and placed it in a 
crystal case to protect his words from the scars of time. In 
a final act of despair, he shattered his crown with the 
Keystone of Life, splitting it into uncountable shards, left 
behind in his Tower.

All life ended for a time, but as things go, life returned to 
our planet, four races led by four kins, wearing crowns 
bearing the main shards of the splintered Keystone of Life. 
Each had a queen at his side; all wandered from Aran's 
Tower to build their kingdoms and weave their own 
tapestry in the world. And in time, other dark and 
nameless creatures crept from the cauldrons, bearing the 
tiny shards of the Keystone that created them, following 
the kings into a new world.

Four races developed and prospered: Elves, Dwarves, 
Humans and Orcs. As time passed, the four territories 
crossed, and their differences spilled out of the shadows.

The Elves are a natural people, loving sunlight and forest 
shade--a tall, fair and elegant species, always vigilant 
against attack. They have one skill on their side--a 
knowledge of Magic. They protect their culture with the 
double-edged sword of defense and art. Their's is the first 
great empire, sprawling the central forest of Aldarien and 
the vast tree belt of the Southlands.

The Dwarves, too, are a solitary race. They are short and 
stocky, and few in number. As creatures of habit--mainly 
miners, builders and smiths--their psyche is governed by 
a desire to delve forever deeper for the magical core metal 
of the world. They are a disparate, hostile people, going 
wherever the mining is good, given to territorial defense. 
Their main settlements are close to the Tower, the place 
now known as Naugarth, the Dwarf realm.

Men are the Land's farmers. They breed quickly because 
their lifespan is short, and this makes them more desperate 
than most. They rejected the power of Magic long, long ago, 
choosing instead the path of science. They have always 
been an expansionist species and they soon spread their 
corruption into the Great Plain and east into Hardor.

Finally, this world hosts Orcs. These creatures, as has been 
well recorded elsewhere, are warriors--efficient fighting 
machines who live and die by sword and statecraft, craving 
power and glory. An Orc runs from battle when it 
calculates that the odds are against it.

So, the world was divided among the races. The ELves 
ruled the forests, the Dwarves held the underworld, Men 
ploughed the plains and the Orcs held sway over the wastes 
and mountains. The Age of Conflist begins.

After many years of interracial conflict had devastated the 
land and its inhabitants, the Watcher came and settled in 
Aran's Tower. From warring and poverty, all four races 
have slowly declined, their economies and towns crum-
bling in unison. Once there were great cities here; now 
there are villages and settlements. Once there were huge 
nations; now there are dwindling rows of stragglers. Once 
there were empires; now there are memories.

No one knows from where the Watcher came. Or why. 
Perhaps he was an emissary from the Lords of Creation--
a restorer of balance. He has withdrawn the gift of 
Magic--wizards have no power, and the only sorcery in 
the land emanates from artifacts fashioned before he 
arrived. It is a time for union: to this end, he has cast a spell 
of apathy upon the four kings, and spoken this prophecy:

    "Where there is chaos, there will be order;
    where discord, harmony will flourish. From 
    the south will come a hero to conquer the land 
    and unite the crowns. Where there were 
    fragments, there will be a whole. Then will a 
    new age begin."

The land awaits its hero.

II. GENERAL INFORMATION

  1. THE BARS

Health ~ red bar
  The HP bar indicates how close you are to getting killed. Health is damaged 
by getting hit by melee or missile attacks and is restored by using food or 
healing potions. The healing points from healing items is preferentially 
distributed to the most wounded members of the group.
  Health starts at 70/72 and the maximum increases by 2 for each new level 
visited, regardless of whether you forced or bought your passage.

Morale ~ green bar
  Low morale causes troops break formation and wander off, but morale seems to 
have no other effect. It goes up when you hurt/kill enemies and goes down when 
you or your troops get hurt/killed. 
  Whether it goes up or down, it eventually equilibrates to 31/125 and the 
equilibrium increases by 1 for each new stage you visit, regardless of whether 
you forced or bought your passage.

Skill ~ blue bar
  Skill affects a character's chance to hit and chance to avoid getting hit in 
combat.
  It starts at 41/255 (warriors get a +10 bonus) and increases by 1 for each 
stage in chapters 1-2, 2 for each stage in chapters 3-6, or 3 for each stage 
in chapter 7, regardless of whether you forced or bought your passage.

  In all cases, you don't earn the bonus until you travel to a stage you 
haven't been to before.
  The bars you see for your troops are the average values for all the troops. 
If the health of one troop is low but all the others is high, the bar will 
appear to be high. This makes it hard to tell if one of them needs healing. 
If you see the red bar going down and then suddenly increase, that means one 
of your guys just got killed. Get into the habit of using a healing item every 
few seconds when your troops are in intense melee combat.

  2. COMBAT

  There are two types, melee and missile. To use your missile effectively, 
approach the enemy from one of the eight cardinal directions. Even if you are 
confident in your sword you should always try to line up a few shots because 
it is basically free damage. Enemy missiles are generally weaker than yours.
  Melee happens, whether you want it or not, when the enemy gets close to you. 
If you are being melee'd you can't move or shoot; you can only melee back, 
though you can opt not to defend yourself. Melee is more effective if you push 
the button fast, but there's a limit to how much good this does, and your 
troops always seem to be better at melee than your own character. (The game's 
heavy lag can result in many of your button presses and releases to go missed.)
A good tactic is to have them melee while you support them with missiles.
  For both attack types, there is a chance that the attack will fail: The 
enemy doesn't flicker and doesn't take damage. This depends on the Skill stats 
of both opponents, the attacker's weapon, the defender's armor, and random 
factors. See section III.4 for details.

  3. MANAGING YOUR TROOPS

  This game can be very hard or not so hard depending on how well you can 
control your troops. On many stages you have to fight enemies that are plain 
better than you. In order to beat them you need to have a well controlled army 
so that you can get as many swords on them at once as possible, otherwise you 
get taken out one by one. 
  Battle Master has the distinction of having some of the worst AI pathing 
ever. Troops will get lost and literally grope their way along if you try to 
do something wild like walk along a wall or through a door. The best way to 
prevent them from getting lost is to make sure they only walk where you walk. 
You can do this by leading from the rear and choosing single file formation. 
Waggle the stick up and down, left and right repeatedly. In their attempt to 
get ahead of you your troops will eventually settle on top of you. As long as 
you keep moving they should remain this way.
  If your troops start going after enemies when you need them to be following 
you, Rally them. This makes them ignore enemies and follow you for a few 
seconds. Rallying is good for keeping your troops together until you are ready 
to attack. Do not rally when they are in melee unless you are trying to pull 
them out of combat. Rallying in no way cures the horrible pathfinding. You 
cannot rally if you can parley or access the travel map.
  You can save yourself a lot of trouble by telling your troops to wait behind 
when you are doing something they can't help you with, like scouting and 
getting treasure. Sometimes you have to make them stay put for their own good.
  You can only buy troops when parleying with someone of the same race. The 
cost for each man is twice the cost of safe passage. You can buy more than four
at a time by leaving the parley screen then returning to it.
  If you can properly line up just one or two shots with a strong missile you 
can devastate entire parties of enemies. There is a trick you can use to take 
out enemies at a distance with your missile: 
  Stack up your troops as described above, then make then wait at a location 
where they are lined up to hit enemies. Approach the enemies until they start 
attacking you. Your guys should start firing, and not many enemies can survive 
being hit by 10 or more missiles. Try to get the enemy to chase you so your 
troops can keep shooting them. You can also do this trick while moving: if 
everyone's shot is synchronized, you can retreat while they are reloading and 
face the enemy just before they fire.

  4. CLEARING STAGES

  You are free to leave a stage when you've killed 3/4 of inital number of 
residents, rounded up. That includes humanoids and monsters. Once you've done 
this you can come and go at will. You can also buy safe passage, but this is 
only good once per purchase. Whenever you leave a stage, any stage-specific 
items (such as keys) are returned to their original places, and all triggers 
(like pit traps) are reset.
  You get the same bonus to your stats whether you pay for passage or kill 
every last monster, so consider just getting what you want and leaving. If you 
choose what treasure is important ahead of time (by using this guide) you can 
decide which stages to skip by parleying, saving a lot of time and trouble. 
While you don't need to go through every stage, it's a good idea to parley 
through the uninteresting stages just to get the stat bonus. This only works 
for non-wilderness stages, though wilderness stages tend to be a little easier.
  So, try to visit every stage but don't fight through all of them. It takes 
too long and you'll end up with more gold than you can spend.

  5. GP AND PARLEYING

  GP is used to buy healing items, equipment, troops and safe passage during 
Parley. Therefore, GP gives you the choice to skip some levels you don't want 
to deal with and still get the benefits. GP is collected in stages cleared by 
force and spent in stages cleared by parley. It doesn't do you any good unless
you spend it, so plan on where and when to spend it to make the game easier.

  The icon of a treasure item is automatically determined by the quantity of GP
it holds.

Table 1: GP item icons
+-----------+-------------+
| GP amount |     icon    |
+-----------+-------------+
|    0-24   |  coin pile  |
|   25-49   | small pouch |
|   50-99   | large sack  |
|  100-4095 |    chest    |
+-----------+-------------+

  Merchants get discounts on their purchases. This means less GP is needed to 
buy passage and other goods, which means that fewer stages need to be raided
for money.

Table 2: Merchant discounts
+-------+----------------------------------+
|  You  |               Them               |
|       | Human   Elf   Dwarf   Orc   wild |
+-------+----------------------------------+
| Human |  15%    10      5     10      -  |
| Elf   |  10     15     10      5      -  |
| Dwarf |   5     10     15      -      -  |
| Orc   |  10      5      -     20      -  |
+-------+----------------------------------+

  Dwarves and Orcs will never parley with each other, not even with merchants. 
Also, Elves and Orcs will charge each other double for safe passage, but not 
for other goods. Parleying is not available in wilderness stages.

  6. HOSTILITY
  Besides the distinctions when parleying, some races will attack others 
without provocation.

Table 3: Racial hostility
+-------+----------------------------------+
|  You  |               Them               |
|       | Human   Elf   Dwarf   Orc   wild |
+-------+----------------------------------+
| Human |   -      -      -      X      X  |
| Elf   |   -      -      X      X      X  |
| Dwarf |   -      X      -      X      X  |
| Orc   |   X      X      X      -      X  |
+-------+----------------------------------+

  For example, if you have an Elf party in the presence of Dwarves, your 
troops and their troops will spontaneously attack each other. Orcs are at a 
disadvantage because they are hated by every other race, while Humans are the 
least unwelcome. Wilderness stages are hostile to everyone.
  Hostility does not prevent parleying, as long as no blood has been shed. 
Taking GP and items, even zero-value items like keys, causes hostility to break
out, and also disables parleying for every class except thieves. Getting hit by
missile traps also causes hostility but oddly enough it's still cool if 
characters get killed by pit traps.

  7. CHOOSING YOUR CHARACTER

  You need to pick a race and a class. There are four choices of each. Race 
affects hostility and parleying, and also the starting stage. Class affect 
starting conditions, and each class gets except warriors get special abilities.

Table 4: Initial conditions of each class
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| class    |  troops |   gold  |  skill  | missile |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
| Thief    |     4   |    50   |    41   |  +0 bow |
| Warrior  |     0   |     0   |    51   |  +0 bow |
| Wizard   |     2   |    50   |    41   | +30 wand|
| Merchant |     3   |   100   |    41   |  +0 bow |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+

Table 5: Initial equipment types by race and class
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
|  class   |                            race                           |
|          |    Human           Elf           Dwarf           Orc      |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Thief    | [A0][W3][M2] | [A0][W2][M1] | [A1][W4][M0] | [A1][W4][M0] |
| Warrior  | [A1][W3][M1] | [A0][W0][M2] | [A1][W1][M0] | [A1][W0][M0] |
| Wizard   | [A0][W2][M3] | [A0][W2][M4] | [A0][W1][M3] | [A0][W4][M5] |
| Merchant | [A0][W3][M1] | [A0][W3][M2] | [A1][W0][M2] | [A1][W4][M2] |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
  See section III.1 for details on equipment types.

  Thieves can take items and still be able to parley. In this way they can 
"steal". However, the enemy still attacks you and your troops as if they had 
seen it anyway, so the peace doesn't last long.
  You can steal something and immediately buy passage and leave. If for some 
reason you come back the enemy will no longer be hostile. You can also push 
your luck by hiding your troops out of the way and cleaning the stage out, 
trying not to get hit, then buying passage. Since the implementation of 
stealing is so poor, the thief is probably the worst class. A similar concept 
is more reliably demonstrated by the merchant class.

  Warriors start with an extra 10 skill points that may give them an edge in 
the long run, but no money or friends. Those extra points will not prevent you 
from getting killed at the beginning of the game, so get some troops as soon 
as possible. Warriors don't seem to have any special ability.

  Wizards start with a +30 wand: fire for the human and dwarf, lightning for 
the elf and poison for the orc. Wizards are the only class that can use wands 
effectively, and all the races use them equally well. Non-wizards have a high 
failure rate with wands: You hit the enemy with the projectile but nothing 
happens. See section III.3 for details on this. Because only they can exploit 
the powerful wands effectively, wizards may be the best class.
  Wizards are also the only class that can identify healing potions: other 
classes see "(???)" in place of the number. But this is trivial since potions 
can also be identified by color and cost.

Table 6: Healing potion identification
+-------+---------+---------+
| Price |  Color  | Healing |
+-------+---------+---------+
|   25  |   blue  |  (100)  |
|   37  |  green  |  (150)  |
|   50  |  orange |  (200)  |
|   62  |   red   |  (250)  |
+-------+---------+---------+

  Merchants get Parley discounts as shown in table 2. Since less GP and less 
fighting is needed to fund parleying through stages, merchants may be the class
that can get through the game the fastest.

  8. PASSCODES

  A passcode is a sequence of symbols that codes for the party's current state.
They are only given at the end of chapters. You can resume play at the 
beginning of the chapter by entering the passcode at the main menu.

  The symbols are drawn from a pool of sixteen. The passcode is divided into 
blocks of five/four/four symbols per line, and there are six lines for a 
maximum length of 78 symbols. The block and line divisions do not mean 
anything. The length is always an even number and each pair of symbols codes 
for one byte of a particular parameter. The number of pairs required depends 
on the size of your inventory, and the last two pairs are never used.

Table 7: Functions of passcode symbols
+-------+-----------------------------+
|symbols| function                    |
+-------+-----------------------------+
|  1- 2 | checksum                    |
|  3- 4 | max health                  |
|  5- 6 | current troop health        |
|  7- 8 | number of troops            |
|  9-10 | race and class              |
| 11-12 | chapter and number of items |
| 13-14 | equilbrium morale           |
| 15-16 | skill                       |
| 17-18 | GP, upper byte              |
| 19-20 | GP, lower byte              |
| 21-22 | affects identity of items?  |
| 23-24 | equipped armor              |
| 25-26 | equipped weapon             |
| 27-28 | equipped missile            |
| 29-74 | up to 21 inventory items    |
| 75-78 | unused                      |
+-------+-----------------------------+

  The checksum byte is what prevents any otherwise valid passcode from being 
accepted: the given checksum must match the checksum generated from the 
particular sequence of the other symbols or the passcode is rejected.

See section V for some sample passcodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. IN-DEPTH INFORMATION

  Understanding how combat works at a fundamental level can make Battle Master 
much less aggravating and more playable. This section explains what equipment 
and jewelry does, how damage is computed, and how hits or misses are decided.

  1. EQUIPMENT TYPES

  Every object in the game world has a two-part identification number, which 
indicates the item's main type and subtype. Some examples of main types are 
armors, healing items, and keys. The main type determines, among other things, 
what happens when you pick the item up and how it is sorted in inventory. The 
subtype determines the icon and other subtype-specific properties.
  The Optimise command in the inventory menu checks for multiple equipment 
items of the same subtype and automatically throws away everything but the 
strongest item. There's no benefit to keeping weaker items of the same subtype,
so Optimise is always safe to use. It won't appear unless there's something it 
can throw away.
  This guide will represent IDs in the format of [XY], where X shows the main 
type and Y is the subtype. The main types of interest here will be called A 
(armor), W (melee weapon), M (missile weapon), R (rings), and J (jewelry). The 
following table explains what each equipment subtype looks like and where to 
find the best specimen. (Some are not found anywhere in the game.) The meaning 
of the plus values is different for each type and will be explained in this 
section.

Table 8: Equipment types

  2. RINGS AND JEWELRY

  Unlike other item types, each ring and jewel subtype has a unique function.

Table 9: Ring and jewel functions
+------+---------------------------------+
|  ID  | function                        |
+------+---------------------------------+
| [R0] | resist all attacks              |
| [R1] | resist fireballs                |
| [R2] | resist gas                      |
| [R3] | resist lightning                |

| [R5] | walk safely over pits and lava  |
| [R6] | unknown and not in game         |
| [R7] | unknown and not in game         |
| [R8] | unknown and not in game         |
+------+---------------------------------+
| [J0] | resist fireballs*               |
| [J1] | resist fireballs*               |
| [J2] | resist scorpion attacks*        |
| [J3] | unknown                         |
| [J4] | resist gas*                     |
| [J5] | resist fireballs/gas/lightning* |
| [J6] | resist fireballs/gas/lightning* |
| [J7] | resist lightning*               |
+------+---------------------------------+

  The only ring/jewel actually found in the game that has no known function is 
[J3] Faith. Since it's +0 it probably has a non-combat effect like Nendil and 
Gondrim.
  The only ring/jewel that protects against a specific race is the [J2] Holy 
Necklace. It resists any attack from any scorpion. Refer to table 14 for the 
details on attack resistance.

  3. DAMAGE FORMULA

  For the player group attacking enemy groups, the damage dealt is:
[damage] = [weapon power]*[wand/crossbow reduction] + [armor modifier] + 1

  For enemy groups attacking the player group, the damage dealt is:
[damage] = ([weapon power] + [armor modifier])*[enemy reduction] + 1

  Skill and armor power affect whether the attack connects, but not the damage 
done. However, the armor type plays a big role in damage. For each combination 
of the attacker's weapon and the defender's armor there is a modifier added or 
subtracted to the damage. (Pluses are good for the attacker and bad for the 
defender.)

Table 10: Damage modifiers from weapon/armor pairings
+------+---------------------------------------------------+
|attack|                       armor                       |

+------+---------------------------------------------------+

  The base damage of wands ([M3], [M4], [M5]) and heavy crossbows ([M6]) is 
less than advertised. The plus value of the missile weapon is multiplied by 
$570A/$10000, or about 33%, rounded down. This applies to all classes and puts 
wands only marginally above bows in terms of damage.

Table 11: Wand and heavy crossbow damage reduction
+--------------+---------+---------+
| missile type | nominal |  actual |
+--------------+---------+---------+
|              |   +20   |    +6   |
|              |   +30   |   +10   |
| [M3][M4][M5] |   +40   |   +13   |
|     wands    |   +60   |   +20   |
|              |   +80   |   +27   |
|              |  +100   |   +33   |
|              |  +120   |   +40   |
+--------------+---------+---------+
|     [M6]     |    +5   |    +1   |
| big crossbows|   +15   |    +5   |
+--------------+---------+---------+

  Furthermore, for non-wizards only, the wand is used at a skill level equal to
the reduced damage level, which is always much lower than base skill. This 
means that non-wizards have a high chance of missing with wands and should 
stick to bows. Wizards take no penalty and use wands at normal skill. Any class
can use heavy crossbows at normal skill.

  The wand/crossbow reduction only applies to the player group attacking enemy 
groups. Enemy groups attacking the player get a different damage reduction.
  Before adding the final +1, the damage is multiplied by $4CCC/$10000, or 
about 30%, rounded down. This is applied after the armor modifier, so the 
damage reduction of the player's armor is greatly reduced.

  4. CHANCE-TO-HIT FORMULA

  Whether an attack hits or misses is determined by the following algorithm.

Table 12: Chance to hit formula
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|             operation           |                 notes                 |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
|          start from zero        |                                       |
| -     defender group's skill    |                                       |
| + attacker group's weapon power |     wand/crossbow power is reduced    |
| +     attacker group's skill    | wand skill is reduced for non-wizards |
| -  defender group's armor power |                                       |
| +  weapon/armor damage modifier |                                       |
| +        formation bonus        |     only applies to melee attacks     |
| +  random number from 0 to 31   |                                       |
| +  random number from 0 to 31   |                                       |
| -     ring/jewel protection     |   only applies to the player's group  |
| -               25              |                                       |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
  If the result is greater than zero, the attack succeeds. (This algorithm does
not account for the neutralization effect that happens when the opponents are 
attempting to melee one other simultaneously.)

  The formation bonus only applies to melee attacks and the formations of each 
group are only relevant if both groups have more than one member. If the 
attacker is alone, the bonus is 6. If there's more than one member in the 
attacker's group and the defender is alone, the bonus is 12. Otherwise, the 
bonus is looked up from the following table.

Table 13: Group formation chance to hit bonuses
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|attacker|                       defender                      |
|        | column    wedge    line    single    open    huddle |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| column |    0   |    5   |    9   |    5   |    5   |    5   |
|  wedge |    5   |    8   |   11   |    5   |   10   |    5   |
|   line |    0   |    5   |    0   |    0   |    5   |    0   |
| single |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |
|   open |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |
| huddle |    0   |    5   |    0   |    5   |    5   |    0   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  The best offensive formations are column and wedge, the best defensive 
formations are column and huddle, and being alone is very disadvantageous.

  You can't directly do anything with the rings and jewels in your inventory. 
The combat-oriented rings and jewels are used automatically when you are 
attacked, and each one protects against certain attacks.

+------+--------------------+------------------------------+

  The plus value of the item is subtracted from the quantity that will 
determine if you get hit. You can only get the ring/jewel bonus from one item. 
If multiple bonuses are applicable, only the best one is applied. For example, 
if you have both The Emerald Star ([J4]) and Sulandir ([R2]), and you get 
attacked by gas ([M5]), you get the +30 bonus from Sulandir while the +20 bonus
from The Emerald Star is overridden.
  Unlike rings, the jewels that protect against magic also protect against 
melee weapons with the same ID number. For example, the Ruby Star protects 
against fire [M3] but also certain swords [W3]. This is clearly a glitch. 

  5. EQUIPMENT ADVICE

  Picking the right equipment for the situation can make the difference between
certain doom and a chance at winning. The most important thing is to have the 
best armor or weapon ready to counter the opponent's equipment. (Refer to table
10.) The weapon/armor matchup not only affects damage but the chance to hit. 
Although the modifier along with the base damage is scaled down to 30% for the 
enemy's attacks, you still get the full benefit or penalty for the chance to 
hit calculation.
  Leather and chainmail ([A0] and [A1]) are available with large plus values 
but have poor modifiers, whereas dragonskin ([A7]) offers superb protection. 
The best you can do for most of the game is gray armor ([A2]).
  All the common melee weapon types are good against certain armors, so you 
should keep strong weapons of various types ready for different situations.
  Despite the base damage reduction, [M6] crossbows have a hefty bonus against 
[A3] armor, which is common on wild creatures. Otherwise bows tend to be pretty
similar. Wizards should generally use wands, but be ready to use something 
other than fire if the enemy has [A7] or [A8]. The scattershot effect of gas 
wands can be good or bad depending on the tactical situation. Non-wizards 
should not even touch wands.
  Don't hang onto worthless rings and jewelry. You can only benefit from one 
item at a time, and the shield rings work against everything, so anything that 
isn't better than your shield ring should be tossed. Even then, magic attacks 
are somewhat uncommon.
  Try to observe the enemy's formation and pick a counter-formation to maximize
offense or minimize risk. (Refer to Table 13.) Formation only matters for 
melee, so you can change it right before engaging the enemy.

  To the NW is a bottle half-shadowed by a fake cave entrance. To the E of that
hidden in the dirt is a 45 GP pouch.
  Once in the cave to the N, avoid the E/W passage at the far N because of the 
pits. There's a 60 GP sack in a central chamber and a 45 GP pouch E of there. 
Follow the passages south to a 20 GP pile but don't take it yet. To get to the 
wand, head W along the northern passage to avoid pits. Go around the long way 
to the wand, then leave by the southern passage with the crucified person on 
the wall and finally get the coins.

  Approach the nearby altar to make the Holy Bone of Aegrog appear across the 
river in the spider's lair. I recommend you leave your troops on the other side
of the river to shoot at the spiders. Go across and lure the big one to your 
guys. Use the bone in the cave to the north to get the treasure, including 
sacks of 55 GP and 65 GP, and a chest of 150 GP.

  Kill the ogre and cross to find a 70 GP sack, chainmail, and food. 
  To the N there is a Stout Pole which you will need to push the slab. Across 
the river, there's some Pretty Flowers on the W. Go between the rocks to the NE
where the pillar is and you'll reach a shrine. Bring the flowers to the cave 
and you'll get the axe and wand. If you try to enter the cave without bringing 
flowers, or approach the shrine from the N instead of the W, you'll get killed.
  To the N and NE are some spiders guarding some apples.

  Beware the green monsters on this stage. Avoid letting your guys melee 
through walls, because they usually end up killed. Rally them if they do this.
  The Square Key, which unlocks the compound, is found to the north. There's a 
40 GP pouch in the hut. Once down the ladder, there's a 55 GP sack to the far 
W, a 200 GP chest to the far N, and a 150 GP chest to the far S near the bow. 
If big pits appear on the left and right sides of this area, there's enough 
space next to them to squeeze by.
  There's a 50 GP sack in the bedroom to N of the ladder room, but a pit will 
trap you inside. You can get out by touching the W mirror behind the beds, then
the E mirror, then the S wall across from mirror in the ladder room. You might 
want to do this after eliminating the enemies.

  Watch out for the humongous bug on your way N to the cave. Once inside, keep 
left as the message says. This cave is a long, unbranching spiral. You can cut 
to the end by touching the torch in the NW corner. The only thing you'll miss 
is some pit traps and another bug. If going the long way, be sure to keep right
after the torch to avoid a pit.
  The door at the end of the tunnel leads to a new cave area. There's another 
door just to the NE which leads to a 120 GP chest. There's a 30 GP pouch to the
NW, a 20 GP pile to the NE, another at the E end, and a 40 GP pouch to the SE.
  The door at the S end of this room leads to a shrine with a pit that traps 
you with a very tough orc. Besides the other items, there's a 310 GP chest 
here. To leave the shrine, walk toward the altar, then move to one side and 
head back to the door. The pit should be gone.

  There's a 55 GP sack off to the W, and SW across the river is a 45 GP pouch.
Approaching the treasures to the NE will teleport you into the caves. Inside, 
there's an 80 GP sack nearby to the NE. The stone arches don't lead anywhere 
yet. There's a 100 GP chest at the W end of these caves, and another by the 
exit to the SE.
  Find your way to three crucified guys. Go right until another victim at the 
dead end talks to you. Now go back to the crossroads and go left this time. You
should get a Diamond Key at the dead end. (Sometimes this doesn't work, and you
get killed anyway by the pit trap on the left.)
  Return with the key to the archways and walk through the one on the left, 
which now leads to the treasure. Bring your troops, because an angry elf on 
smack will appear and attack. Among the other goods is a 250 GP chest.
  The bottle that appears half buried in the hillock by the cave exit seems to 
be unreachable.

after fighting off the snakes, you'll find food, a Gold Key, and a 100 GP 
chest. Back outside, there is a 50 GP sack to the far NE. Go back in the 
direction of where the bow was and look for a place to go E into the swamp. 
The path leads to two huts. The one to the N a 80 GP sack. Use the Gold Key to 
open the one to the S. Inside there's food and a 170 GP chest.

  There's a 20 GP pile near the start position and a Gardeners Spade in the 
center of the map. There is a teleport maze by the hut to the NE that you need 
the shovel to bypass. Walk between the dancing flowers, then N a bit, then E 
past the rock, then S, using the shovel to pass the leafy plant. Then go W. 
You'll be teleported to an apple, the Earth Mages Spellbook, and a 60 GP sack. 
The book opens the door to the house to the SW. Inside that house is food, the 
sword, and a 200 GP chest. If a pit is blocking the door, Travel away and come 
back.

  The archway to the NE near the start leads to a 10 GP coin pile and an Iron 
Key. It unlocks the bedroom that is reached by going through the double arch in
the center of the island. In the bedroom is a 10 GP pile and a Storeroom Key. 
The storeroom is two levels down and has a 120 GP chest.
  The archway in the SE has a Guardroom Key, which unlocks the room on the 
right. Hidden in the SW corner is the Priests Key, which opens the other door. 
In there is the Priests Prayer Book, and downstairs there is a 40 GP pouch and 
an 80 GP sack. 
  The far NW archway leads to a 50 GP sack. The archway S of the shrine leads 
to a room with a 10 GP pile and a false bookcase. The bookcase door just leads 
to the shrine outside. Approach the blue orb with the book to make the treasure
appear, including the Ruby Star. The lightning traps should be deactivated. 
Walking all the way to the N wall of the shrine will result in death.
  One of the tombstones on the W on the island hides a random ghost.

  There are three keeps in this area, to the E, SW and NW, and a huge main 
gate to the N. The Portcullis Key to the E keep is in the bushes to the NE.
  Inside in the unlocked central room there is a Bronze Key, which unlocks 
the wooden door the the E. To the N is an 80 GP sack and a Small Key. The door 
to the W unlocks from behind, without a key. There are three 10 GP piles but 
beware the pits that appear if you walk along the door's wall. There are stairs
to the SW and SE. The SE stairs lead to food. The SW stairs leads to a trap 
room. Flip the far left and far right switches to open the door. Other 
combinations result in pits. Walking along the wall of the switches results in 
gas traps, so approach them from below. There's a 50 GP sack partially hidden 
in the SE of the next room. The wooden door is opened with the Small Key from 
upstairs. In the far S room is another Portcullis Key, armor, and a 50 GP sack,
as well as a button on the wall, Gate Control No 1.
  Take the key to the SW keep. Flip the switch on the wall and go through the 
door that opens. There is a 30 GP pouch here, and a Strongroom Key hidden under
the table. Downstairs, unlock the strongroom and find a third Portcullis 
Key, an axe, a 40 GP pouch, and Gate Control No 2. There is a Bedroom Key 
hidden to the SW. It opens the wooden door that was locked upstairs, revealing 
a 70 GP sack.
  Now you can go to the NW keep. Inside there's a 50 GP sack and a Gold Key 
which opens the locked room with food downstairs. Down another level there 
is a second switch room. You have to get all the switches to go down. There is 
a 200 GP chest and Gate Control No 3.
  With the three gate controls pressed, you can now flip the Master Gate 
Control by the main gate. After a long, dark passage and a whole lot of ghosts,
you can finally teleport to the Lighthammer wand. However, there's a shortcut 
to the wand: walk E through the rocks at the main gate.

  There is quicksand in the SE corner of the map, not that there's any reason 
to go there. To get to the uninhabited island where Repentance is, walk between
the two trees to the NW. 
  There's a 50 GP sack in the NE corner of the village. In the NE hut there's a
55 GP sack and an Arrow Key. The unfinished building has a 35 GP pouch, a 200 
GP chest, and a 20 GP pile. The key unlocks the door here. The passage connects
to a hut on the SW island, which has only enemies on it.

  Across the bridge there is a small cave to the W that just has carrots. A 
bit to the N there is another with just corn. N of that there is one with fish 
and a 30 GP pouch. The northernmost cave takes you across the river. From here 
follow the river north and you get teleported to the SE part of the map. At the
end of the trail is a cave.
  The E path in the cave leads to treasure including a 30 GP pouch and a 80 GP 
sack, but stay in the center of the tunnel to avoid pits. The W path at the 
intersection goes outside to a new area. To the N is a cave behind some bushes 
with treasure, including a 110 GP chest.
  Outside, farther N is cave leading to the Gnak Brothers Pit. The messages say
they are invincible, but they happily fell before my weapons. There's a 100
GP chest S of the torture chamber. The wand and a 120 GP chest is in the SW 
room. At the NW there's an exit that just leads to an apple and more orcs.

  Downstairs, to the SW is the Square Key, which opens the door to the NE. 
Through the door is a 15 GP pile, and to the SE is the Spike Key, which opens 
the door to the SW. Through there is a 150 GP chest, and to the NW is a 50 GP

  There's a dragon just N of your position. Pick your weapons carefully and try
to take it out with missiles. Its hoard includes a 50 GP sack and a Gate Key. 
The gate is to the NW. In the new area, there are two keeps, each with two 
locked doors. The Gate Key for each is right in front of them. The Iron Key for
each is in the courtyard of the other keep. You will need to explore the E keep
first.
  In there is a Brass Key and a 50 GP sack. Bring the key to the W keep and use
it to get into the storeroom, which contains a Gold Key. Back in the E keep, 
this key unlocks a door that leads to a 100 GP chest. Watch out for the pit 
trap at the bottom of the stairs. Take a step left to trigger it then wait for 
it to disappear. In this room there are some punk teleport traps, but 
eventually you'll make it to the potion, ring, and a 295 GP chest.

  In the hall to the NW there is a 150 GP chest. There is another in the

where to find a key. There is an 85 GP sack in the false cave to the E, along 
with the Gold Key. It unlocks the other hut to the NE, which contains a 200 GP

  The lava bridge is covered by numerous fireball traps which you can't dodge 
because there's no room. Walking off the bridge into the fire results in death.
On the island at the end of the bridge, guarded by a mean scorpion, is the 
Portcullis Key.
  If you walk off the N of the island you will be teleported over to the W to 
the group of scorpions guarding the sword. If you try taking your troops, some 
will throw themselves into the lava trying to get over to you. If you want 
Absolution without losing troops, either buy it or take out the scorpions by 
yourself little by little, doing teleport hit & runs with your missile.
  In any case you can now enter the gate with the key. In the dormitory are 
three 50 GP sacks and a 100 GP chest. The path to the E leads to food.
  The cave at the N end of the dormitory leads to a track with lava on either 
side, only this time the scorpions are attacking from the lava. You should 
immediately tell your troops to halt and try to lure the scorpions onto the 
tracks so your guys can nail them with missiles. There is a 225 GP chest and a 
200 GP chest in the room at the end of the tracks, along with the super healing
potion and armor.

  The ladder to the E of the start doesn't seem to lead anywhere. In the NW 
corner is the Diamond Star, which is practically worthless because of its low 
plus value. More useful is the non-steaming heap of Dragon Dung. In the cave 
to the NE there is A Handy Lever on the far side of the river. From the close 
side, follow the river W and use the lever to open the door from behind. Flip 
the switch that you find down the ladder.
  The switch makes a door appear in the wall just N of the starting position. 
The door leads to four dragon steaks, Norbane, and the armor. The dung will 
open the door by the switch, and that door will teleport you to the bridge near
the dragon. Past the dragon (easy with Norbane), there's a new cave entrance, 
which leads to a total of 675 GP.
  There are no more dragons in the game, so Norbane isn't so useful now, but 
don't miss out on the best armor in the game, Feadil's Bladewall.

  Teleport from the standing stones to the E or walk across the bridge to 
reach two other standing stones. You should get a message about a horn. Go to 
the SW corner to find the Horn of the Gatekeeper. Watch out on the bridge: you 
have to walk along the middle or you die. The horn will open the main gate of 
the castle.
  In the northern area there's a 100 GP chest and a Diamond Key. The key 
unlocks the door on the W, near a 75 GP sack. Past the door and upstairs, go S 
for a Grey Key and a 125 GP chest. Back in the courtyard go E for a 25 GP 
pouch. You can unlock the door here with the Grey Key. Upstairs and S you'll 
find the pendant and chests worth 350 GP.

  In this stage there are two separate underground networks, both with many 
entrances from the surface. It's a mess. In one of the networks, which I will 
call network A, there is a pit trap room to the S with a 100 GP chest. The 
passage to the SE of the room leads to a cave with a 200 GP chest and the 
Staff of Flight. There is also 20 GP pile to the SW and 80 GP sack to the NE 
in network A.
  The staff will teleport you across a long pit in the central part of network 
A. The passage leads to the armor. If you return to where the pit was it is 
now gone, unblocking the exit that leads to the jewel. Don't use the staff 
before you are ready to Travel, because the programmers forgot to remove the 
teleportation tiles after the staff has been used.
  Network B has a 50 GP sack in the SW room and a 100 GP chest in the NW room, 
a 35 GP pouch in the central room.

  There's a 155 GP chest in the SE corner, a 50 GP sack to the SW, and a 45 GP 
pouch in the NW corner. "The gate never opens," but there is a cave in the NE 
corner that leads behind it.
  The back area has a pit trap that opens when you take a step N, which will 
probably kill some orcs and not you. There's a 130 GP chest to the W and 
another cave entrance here. The cave leads to a 250 GP chest and the wand.

  A Gold Key is just across the river to the E, but you have to walk all the 
way around clockwise to get to it. The entrance to the caves is at the end of 
the road near your starting point, partially concealed behind the rock.
  Inside, the key unlocks the door on the S wall of the central chamber. 
Through the door is a 95 GP sack to the E, a 100 GP chest to the W, a 50 GP 
sack to the NE and another to the SW. The doors in these caves all teleport you
to other doors in the same area.

to the NE. The crown piece is in the S part of the pitch black area.

  The E and W exits of the city teleport to each other. In the house a bit to 
the W of your starting position there's a 120 GP chest. A house to the N of 
that has a Rusty Old Key. It unlocks a room in a large building to the N that 
contains the Palace Key. In that building there is a pit trap in front of the 
blue potion. Avoid it by hugging the wall. The key unlocks the gate at the far 
N. A house to the E of the gate has a 150 GP chest downstairs.
  Within the outer walls of the castle, there is a Royal Key to the E. Within 
the inner wall, there are a lot of very strong, very mean guys. Leave your 
troops in the outer wall, lure a few guys toward the door, then go and bring 
your troops back. Repeat this a couple times until you've broken them into 
manageable groups. Through the N exit, there's 500 GP and a door that is 
unlocked by the Royal Key. A piece of the crown is here. Through the door is 
a 250 GP chest and Normellon.
  The walls in the SE corners of the crown room and the great hall are fake and
you can walk around in the black area. It's probably a glitch. You might 
exploit this to get to the crown more easily.
  The NW stairs in the crown room take you to a dungeon a pit trap and a false 
bookcase. Avoid the pit by hugging the N wall.
The bookcase leads you to the house that was locked in the W part of town, but 
doesn't lead to treasure. This is a one-way trip: If you backtrack from the 
house to the castle, traps will kill you or the game will crash.

This is the last chance for humans to buy troops.

  In this stage the humans aren't so bad but their pets, especially the fire 
elementals, are dangerous. It's worth taking the time to get all your troops 
out of the starting enclosure to ensure they don't get picked off. An easy way 
out is through the fake wall on the E side. There's a mess of similar-looking 
huts here, and all of the doors can be entered from both the N and S. 
  In the hut to the W of the enclosure there is a 100 GP chest, and a 120 GP 
chest in the hut to the E of it. There is an 80 GP sack in the NE stone hut 
with the wide door, but enter the left side of the door or else it leads to the
inside of the NW hut. The half-and-half hut with the wide door leads to another
80 GP sack.
  The W stone leads to the sword and armor, but you may have to grope around in
the dark to find the exit. There's a 100 GP chest in the central wooden hut 
with the wide door, and another in the stone hut S of that with the wide door. 
The SW hut has a 200 GP chest. There is a 50 GP sack in the hut to the E of 
that. The bow, which is the best in the game, is sitting in the dirt S of the 
starting position.

  There's a 50 GP sack in the hut by the SW fountain. The wooden hut and stone 
hut in the center are connected and have two 100 GP chests. There's an 80 GP 
sack in the NW hut, a 100 GP chest in the hut S of that, and a 30 GP pouch in 
the hut to the SE of that. The hut with a ladder to the N has a 100 GP chest 
downstairs. The stone hut to the E and the NE house both connect to the ring, 
wand, and crown piece. There's a 250 GP chest in the house.

  The dwarves here are very rough. Too bad you have no choice but to fight 
them. There are pit traps scattered all over this stage, so consider buying 
Gondrim from the dwarves before going to war with them.
  There's a 200 GP chest in the N hut, an 80 GP sack in the SE hut, and 
another in the E/central hut with the ladder, and a 100 GP chest in the NW 
hut. As in Kingshold, the caves connect opposite sides of the map.
  Inside the great hall, which is in front of the starting position, walking 
by the left side of the table will trigger a pit. If you don't have Gondrim 
yet, you should have your guys wait in the SE corner of the room and lure 
enemies to them. The pit can be safely triggered from the N. In the hall 
there is a 250 GP chest, the Gondrim ring, and the Palace Key. There is an E 
entrance to the great hall but it doesn't seem to have a key. The palace is to 
the E. On the top floor is Warshield. The crown piece and 400 GP is on the 
bottom floor.

This is the last chance for dwarves to buy troops.

  This stage has an outdoor area and a cavern area, connected by multiple 
exits. The underground passages are all pit trapped, so you will have to 
travel outside if you don't have Gondrim.
  Outside, there's an 80 GP sack at the starting position and a 15 GP pile in 
the SW corner. In the caves, there's a 35 GP pouch in the cave near the start 
and a 45 GP pouch off to the W. There's a 120 GP chest in the E chamber and a 
255 GP chest, a 95 GP sack, and the axe in the N/NE chamber. The armor and a 
255 GP chest are in a branch that starts in the S and goes the NW.

corner. The NW corner has the Gold Key, which unlocks the door in the NW of the
previous area.

  There's a 135 GP chest to the W of the starting point. There's a healing 
potion embedded in the rock near the false cave to the S. To the E of the rock 
is a 255 GP chest. There's a 77 GP sack in the NE and in the NW/central area is
a 23 GP pile. There are two entrances to the caves, found in the NW and NE.
  There is a group of six scorpions with extremely high defense inside. It's 
actually impossible to damage them, even with the best weapons and highest 
skill available at this point. Their armor is just too strong. Fortunately 
their weapons are not any stronger than the other groups, and they have no 
missile. In order to make quota and leave, you'll need to find and kill most of
the other scorpions.
  The invincible group starts out N of the the NW entrance of the caves, so you
want to avoid that area. If you encounter them, you'll need to Rally and run 
away, but it doesn't work if they are already engaged. Trying to get around 
them in the narrow tunnels is hard, and coordinating your troops is made even 
more difficult by the teleport traps.
  There's a 45 GP pouch to the NE. If you try to walk to the SE room you'll 
teleport NW, not far S of the invincible scorpions. Continue S and you'll be 
moved NW again. Going N from here teleports you back to the entrance area, so 
move S and you'll be moved SE this time. N from here is a teleport that goes 
back to where you just came from. Go S and W instead to reach a room with a 
mushroom formation.
  The green mushrooms teleport you to that SE room where you'll find a 255 GP 
chest, a healing potion, and Sulandir. The red mushrooms bring you to the NW 
room with two healing potions and a 200 GP chest. The teleports are one-way so 
you have to do some backtracking if you want both.

  This stage has some very hard-hitting dragonfly groups on the surface and 
bat groups in the caves. There's also pit traps on the surface.
  On the surface level, you'll find in the SE: 20 GP pile, 100 GP chest. SW: 20
GP pile with the carrots on the little island. NW: 20 GP pile. NW/center: 10 GP
pile. N/middle: 30 GP pouch. Center: 180 GP and 200 GP chests. NE corner: 100 
GP. E in some bushes: 20 GP pile.
  There are two cave networks. The first has two entrances, NW (enter the rock 
from the N) and W/central (enter from S). In the cave's tunnels is various food,
two 80 GP sacks, a 50 GP sack, and a 200 GP chest.
  The second cave has only one entrance, to the NE. The long, winding tunnel 
has food, a 50 GP sack, and the wand.

999 GP available

  There are two ways to approach the final stage. You can clear it by force and
even kill enough enemies to travel away and back again, or you can just run for
the objective. Fighting is only an option for well-prepared Warriors, but it's 
not going to be easy because the giant eyes sitting right in front of the gate 
are invincible. Their defense is too strong. But unlike the scorpions in The 
Wastes, the eyes hit dangerously hard.
  Either way, you have to get past the guard eyes somehow. You can lure them 
away but if they lose sight of you they'll quickly return to their position. 
Try to get them stuck on obstacles in the SE or SW, then run for the gate, 
which is unlocked and one-way. It's pretty much impossible to get troops into 
the tower because of the eyes. To do so would require having your men follow 
you in lockstep for the evasive meneuvers, and never letting the eyes get too 
close. You might instead use the troops as disposable decoys.
  On the first floor of the tower there are a bunch of ghosts and will-o-wisps.
There is a lot of room to run around, except for the stairway area by the 
entrance, where you'll be mobbed. There's a 999 GP chest by the altar, as if 
there's anything to spend it on now. The stairs up are in the N/center of the 
lobby.
  There are fewer enemies on the second floor, just two groups of fireballs. 
However, there are pit barriers which can trap you between enemies, so Gondrim 
is really useful. Approach to the throne at the far N to finish the game.

V. SAMPLE PASSCODES

  This first set was collected a long time ago, before the current knowledge. 
No stages were skipped and there's a lot of GP, but the equipment choices 
aren't very good.
