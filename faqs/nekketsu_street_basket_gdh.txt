1. Game summary
 1a. Introduction
  "Nekketsu! Street Basket: Ganbare Dunk Heroes" is a 4-player basketball game 
released by Technos Japan in 1993, making it one of the last NES games licensed 
by Nintendo. It is part of the Nekketsu (Hot-blooded High-school) series 
starring Kunio and Riki (Alex and Ryan of River City Ransom fame). Like most 
Technos games it never made it out of Japan. As you might expect from a Nekketsu
game, it features as much brawling as B-balling.
  The game was ROM-translated by a group called ICE, but only the intro and 
ending scenes and some other parts were done, and the work is unpolished. The 
ICE translation will be disregarded for this work. Using this guide, you should 
be able to get the full game experience, except for the intro and ending scenes.

 1b. Game modes
Story Mode
  This mode is for one player plus a CPU partner or 2-player cooperative. The 
Nekketsu team must defeat the seven American teams twice, alternating between 
away and home games. The home court is at Niagara Falls. After each victory, you
recieve a gift of game-improving equipment from the vanquished team and a new 
password to continue at that point later.
  Each game has two three-minute halves. Before each half, you may choose which 
two players to put in the game, review your players's special moves, and assign 
equipment. If you are teamed with a computer player, you may also arrange what 
commands each button will give.

Battle Mode (Taisen Mode)
  This mode is a 2-on-2 pickup game with up to 4 human players participating. 
In a 2-player game, the players may play on the same or opposite teams. Choose 
any two teams and any venue from the eight available. There are no passwords or
equipment.

Crouching: When the character lands from a jump or air attack, or gets up after 
being knocked down, he kneels momentarily. Press A or B during this time to do a
crouching move.

Getting the ball: If the ball is in motion, just touching it will catch it. 
Unless it's being super shot.

 2c. While holding the ball
A               Pass to teammate
Hold B          Prepare to shoot; delay shot
Release B       Shoot in the direction faced
(see below)     Dunk
(see below)     Super shot (details in section 3b.)

Scoring:
  Bottom baskets   3 points
  Middle baskets   3 points
  Top baskets      4 points

How to dunk, method A:
  While crouching in front of the basket, press B. By pressing up + B the player
will go for the top basket. You may hold up and/or B before crouching to make it
easier. Dunk method A sometimes misses, and it does not work against your own 
baskets.
  
How to dunk, method B:
  Get very close to a basket and press B. You may hold B while approaching the 
basket to make it easier. There are two ways to get close to the basket: 
jumping, and getting launched by a teammate or background feature.

How to throw a super shot from the ground:
  To do a super shot, start dashing toward the basket and shoot the ball after 
running for a certain amount of time, about half a second to a full second of 
dashing. The button may be held to delay the shot, if desired. Dashing too short
or too far results in a high shot or regular shot instead.

            Dashing time           | Effect
    Frames    Seconds     Steps    | 
     33-56   0.55-0.94   3.0-4.5   | Super shot
     57-93   0.95-1.53   4.5-7.5   | High shot
     ----------other------------   | Regular shot

How to throw a super shot from a jump:
  While facing the basket, but not too close, shoot the ball at after starting a
jump or double jump, releasing the button after a certain amount of time. Button
B must be held for about 1/4 second and then released within a 1/15 second 
window.
  A high shot or regular shot is thrown instead if the player is too close to 
the basket, or if the button is held too short or long. However, if the button 
is held very long (requiring a very high jump), another chance to super shot 
comes at about 2/3 second.

    Button B hold time  | Effect
    Frames    Seconds   | 
       <12       <0.20  | Regular shot
     12-16   0.20-0.27  | Super shot
     17-25   0.28-0.42  | High shot
     26-37   0.43-0.62  | Regular shot
     38-42   0.63-0.70  | Super shot
     43-51   0.71-0.85  | High shot
     52+     0.86+      | Regular shot

High shots vs. regular shots:
  A high shot goes for the basket on the highest backboard. A regular shot goes 
for the closest basket, which is usually the lowest one.

How to throw a high super shot:
  This depends on the type of super shot being thrown. Some have to be thrown a 
certain distance from the basket to go high, and some never go high.

 2d. Weapons
Rock            Throw it or hit it around
Wooden box      Throw it, hit it around, or jump on top to use as a platform
Ladder          Throw it, hit it around, or jump on top to use as a platform
                Plug up an opponent's basket by shooting a ladder into it
Trash can       Throw it at an opponent to restrict his arms
                Jump 5 times (or get hit) to get it off
Skateboard      Throw it or jump on it to ride
Basket          Attach it to the opponent's backboard

While holding a weapon:
A               Throw the weapon in the direction faced
B               Set down the weapon (doesn't work while airborne)
L or R + B      "Shoot" the weapon directly at a backboard
Dash + B        Special weapon attack (details in section 3b.)

While on skateboard:
A+B             Jump off
L,L or R,R      Dash left or right
  R or L        Braking attack
  U,U or D,D    180 turn attack, continue dashing
  A or B        Spinning attack (only if not holding the ball)
  A+B           Jump attack
    A+B         Double jump attack
The ball can be catched, passed and shot normally while riding, but dunks and 
super shots do not work.

Getting a basket: If a basket is touched enough times it falls right off the 
backboard. Dunks and attempted dunks make it more prone to falling than 
shooting. A fallen basket can be picked up and shot to reattach it to the same 
or a different backboard. It is possible stick up to two baskets on a 
backboard. Gaining or losing a basket has a big impact on scoring, so try to 
maintain control of them.

While holding a basket:
A               Throw the basket in the direction faced (does no damage)
B               "Shoot" the basket directly at a backboard
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

 2e. Team attacks
  If a player jumps on top of his teammate, the lower player will carry the 
upper one around. Either player may be holding the ball or a weapon, and the 
controls will be as usual, though the upper player will be unable to move 
without jumping off first. If the lower player is empty-handed, he can throw 
the upper one in two ways.

While carrying teammate and with no ball or weapon:
A       Throw the teammate straight up
B       Launch the teammate at basket in the direction faced

Getting launched: When launched, a player goes straight for the nearest basket. 
By holding up while getting launched, the player goes for the top basket. This 
is similar to dunk method A, but the player may still jump and double jump, and 
it can be done anywhere. There are also background features in some venues that 
launch the player in a random direction. (details in section 5.)

Team damage: Most attacks pass through your teammate harmlessly, but super shots
and weapon attacks are indiscriminate.

4. Computer ally command sets
  If teamed with the computer, you can command your ally to perform certain 
actions by pressing and holding button A or B for 10 frames (1/6 second). When 
this is done, the command given appears under the players's names.
  After leaving the team menu, you must select a command set. The are five sets,
identified below by ASCII representations of the "1p" and "C" symbols on the 
court diagram. Each set has four commands, two for when the ally has the ball, 
and two for when he is empty-handed. Choosing a set has another effect, as the 
ally tends to stick to the C position marked on the diagram.
     ____________
    /       C    |   With ball, A: Pass
   /            _|              B: Shoot
  /#           (_|

6. Equipment
  Defeat a team in Story mode and Kunio is awarded with a random gift of 
equipment. Thus, the team will gather 13 pieces of equipment before winning the 
tournament. The team's pool of equipment, as well as their prior wins, are 
stored in the password given between games.
  There are 32 different items in the game, each falling into one of three 
categories. From top to bottom in the equipment menu, they are jersey, shorts, 
and shoes. Each player can wear no more than one of each type at a time. As with
the character move names, I have translated the item names below to the best of 
my ability (i.e., inexpertly).
  The randomness of the item gifts makes it hard to keep track of them if you 
can't read the Japanese script. As a remedy, I have listed each item by its 
identifying memory value in the "ID" column. You can use a debugger or memory 
watcher to read the contents of the addresses below as an alternative means to 
identify your items.

Address         Contents
0x00d3-00e2     un-equipped items
0x06e4-06e6     Kunio's equipped items
0x06e7-06e9     Riki's equipped items
0x06ea-06ec     Godai's equipped items
0x06ed-06ef     Johnny's equipped items
