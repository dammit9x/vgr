1. Gameplay
 1a. Introduction
  "Kunio Kun no Nekketsu Soccer League" is a soccer game in the Kunio-kun 
Nekketsu High School series, best known for River City Ransom. It is the sequel 
to "Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu Soccer-hen", known as "World Cup Soccer" in 
English versions. The sequel was never ported overseas, so this guide uses the 
PentarouZero v1.2 English ROM patch for naming terms with the original Japanese 
in parentheses.

 1b. Game modes
N.League (Nekketsu League)
  Team Nekketsu, representing Japan, plays against 12 teams from various 
countries. You may choose which teams to play against. Some are stronger than 
others. When Japan has at least 16 wins and 70 points, you may advance to the 
playoffs. Win four more games, culminating in the finals vs. Italy, and Nekketsu
takes the Technos Cup.
  Games consist of two 2-minute halves. Before every half, you may adjust the 
team strategy, check the weather forecasts, meet with the players, check the 
team standings, view the profile of the currently assigned team captain, and 
change the background music.
  Between every game, but not during the tournament, a password is given that 
represents the team's wins and losses. League mode may be played solo or with a
second player controlling the goalkeeper. Ties are resolved by penalty kick 
overtime.

Match (Taisen Play)
  Two to four players choose from the six best teams, including Nekketsu, and 
play a single versus match. If players 3 or 4 are present, they control the 
goalies. Player 1 chooses the continent, ground type, and ground condition of 
the field.
  There is no team captain profile, team stats, meeting mode or items. In 
strategy mode, there are only six players to assign--no reserve players. Other 
aspects, including music select and weather forecast, are the same as in League 
mode.

 Penalty (PK Play)
  The teams alternate taking penalty kicks, with each player getting a try. In 
each turn, a lone player is at the goal line and has 8 seconds to score a goal 
while the other player controls the team's default goalie.
  The PK game is for 1 player against the computer or 2 player versus. As in 
match mode, player 1 chooses the playfield conditions.

 1c. Scoring goals
  Goalkeepers are immune to direct attacks and always send attackers flying. 
They are also stronger than other players at withstanding shots and super shots.
Goalies are also the only players who can catch the ball by touching it.
  The simplest way to score a goal is to overwhelm the goalie with a powerful 
shot. Both the goalie and the ball may be knocked away as he tries to catch it, 
or the ball may pass right through the goalie. This won't work if the shooter is
too weak or the goalie has strong defense.
  Another method is to force the goalie to jump or dive to block the ball by 
aiming it high or off to the side. A goalie can't be knocked over during a block
attempt, but a quick follow up shot by the same or different shooter can get in 
the goal before the goalie has a chance to recover.

 1d. Strategy screen
  At the strategy screen (sakusen kaegi) you may change the player formation, 
reassign the player positions among the 12 players, and set the computer AI for 
offense and defense.
  When assigning player positions, the expression on the player's face shows how
suited the player is for the position. This indicator only appears in League 
mode. The first MF position is always the team captain, who is controlled by 
player 1. In multiplayer games, the other player controls the GK.
  In AI control, the top two options determine passing and shooting frequency. 
The third option determines how much defenders spontaneously attack opponents 
with slides and tackles. The last option determines how much the GK attempts to 
play the ball outside of his box. In all cases, left is more. Passing, shooting 
and tackling can also be commanded from the field with the A and B buttons.

 1e. Weather and terrain
  Wind blows around players and the ball, affecting movement speed. Lightning 
strikes, which come without warning, stun and knock over players and electrify 
the ball. An electrified ball shocks players while airborne, so must be kept on 
the ground. Tornados move around the field, drawing in players and the ball. 
Whatever gets sucked in is tossed skyward and put out of play temporarily.
  There are three terrain types: grass, dirt and sand. The ground may also have 
wet spots where movement is slower. Wet ground may turn the ball blue, which 
slows it down. In Match or PK mode, the player may choose any condition from 
Good (bacchiri), with all dry ground, to Wors (saiaku), all wet. With sand, it's
always slow regardless of condition.

 2c. Special moves
  To do a special shot, jump and kick the ball with the correct timing. The kick
should come out near the peak of the jump and the ball should be hit immediately
when the kick comes out. If done correctly, the ball glows red and takes on a 
characteristic motion. Other factors such as stats and items may also affect the
chance of success.
  A regular special shot is done while pressing B without the D-pad. The 
alternate shot is done by pressing B with any direction. (The alternate shot may
also be done by hitting the ball with a doubleteam flip kick at the peak of the 
kick.) Each character has a specific special shot but they all have the same 
alternate shot.
  The alternate shot arcs slowly and lands near the opposing goalie if done at 
long distance. If done at medium or near distance, it quickly travels to the 
ground and bounces, possibly over the goalie. 
  Each Nekketsu member has one special shot and up to two other moves from the 
list below. (Only the moves used by team Nekketsu are shown. Each other team has
a unique special shot.)

 3b. Team meeting
  In the meeting screen, you may view info on the team members and prepare them 
for the next half. Meeting mode is only available in League mode.
  Every member has a mood index (at RAM address 0x05d0) which ranges from 0-15 
and has some effect on the player's performance.

Mood   Appearance
------------------
0xc-f  Ecstatic
0xa-b  Smiling
0x6-9  Indifferent
0x4-5  Frowning
