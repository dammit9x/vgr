1) WALKTHROUGH
  The objective of each chapter is typically to eliminate the invaders, who 
appear in one or more battles. As such, the walkthrough is mainly a list of each
battle and the invaders in each battle. The procedure for defeating invaders is 
always the same, and usually no discussion is necessary for individual battles. 
When other objectives must be completed, they are described in the notes section
afterward.
  This walkthrough is free of spoilers; thus names that might be spoilers are 
replaced with ???
  Some invaders display stereotyped behaviors that are noted beside the 
invader's name and described below:

Instant escape
  When these invaders see you, they disappear immediately. It is possible (but 
difficult and unnecessary) to kill or capture them with traps and monsters while
remaining out of sight.

Front door escape
  When these invaders see you, they head to the front doors and leave the 
castle. These invaders move counterclockwise along the wall of the entrance 
room, making it somewhat easy to catch them with traps.

Cannot get capture credit
  If you capture them, you won't get capture credit. However, you can kill them 
and get kill credit. Thus it is possible to get the genocide bonus but not the 
capture bonuses.

****************************************
    Chapter 1: THE MASTER

1 invader:  Ardebaran  Builder

2 invaders: Indorigo   Soldier
            Doneal     Merchant

Key item:   Skull Key
            Contract
Body collecting: no

Notes:
  Talk to the soldier and go through the doors.
  Follow the soldier to the dining room. This is optional and causes Ardebaran 
to disappear and Doneal to appear. Doneal is the only invader in the game who is
not hostile and doesn't try to escape.
  Go to the den and activate the traps in the order shown on the door. Go to the
prison and get the Skull Key. Unlock the door in the entrance hall and go 
upstairs. Go to the living room and battle Ardebaran. For this battle the traps 
are unlimited.
  Go to the Demon Gate (strategy room) and get briefed. For the next battle you 
can reuse the leftover traps in the living room or lay new ones. From now on you
may lay traps in Power Rooms also. (For this chapter only, you get free access 
to Volt Cages.)
  Go south back toward the elevator to trigger the Indorigo battle. You may also
battle Doneal downstairs (if he is there).
  After Indorigo is defeated, going back to the Demon Gate ends the chapter.

    Chapter 8: THE RESURRECTION

1 invader:  Wizbone     Wizard

Body collecting: yes

Notes:
  The dialog choice at the beginning doesn't matter. You must build a bedroom 
somewhere downstairs to proceed. From now on you can build bedrooms.
  If you finish the battle within 2:00 of when it begins, go to the downstairs 
power room to finish the chapter. This puts you on track for the "good" endings.
  If you take longer than 2:00, the battle starts over. When it's finished, go 
to the demon gate. Choosing the first dialog option gets you the She-Death 
monster. Either way you are on track for the "bad" endings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) CHARACTER LEVELS
  When the character accumulates enough experience from defeating invaders, his 
level rises and the stats Skill, Def., vsMgc, and Heal each go up 1-3 points 
randomly. (The most important of these is Skill.) For levels 2-10, new abilities
are learned as well.
  The amount of experience required for the level-up is deducted from the total;
thus the actual required experience is greater than it appears. Defeating 
invaders with capture or kill traps is the only way for the character to get 
experience; when an invader is killed by a monster, all of the experience goes 
to the monster.

3) TRAPS
  Defeating invaders is the principal objective of the game, and traps are the 
primary method of defeating invaders. Traps may be laid in the strategy session 
before every battle, at the crystal in the demon gate, or at power rooms.
  A latent trap is indicated in the 3D environment by a red arrow pointing 
toward the ceiling, floor, or wall, depending on where the trap comes from. 
When an invader approaches the trap, the arrow spins and a beep sounds. The 
closer the invader is, the faster the spinning and beeping. To activate a trap, 
point the view of the character to the arrow, with no doors or walls in the way,
and press circle. (The exception is the Banish trap.) If an invader is in range,
he will either be caught or escape, depending on the trap's Success%, the 
invader's defense, and the character's Skill rating. Only one trap or monster 
animation may be in progress at a time.
  Traps may have three effects on invaders: Confused traps cause the target to 
wander dazed for a number of seconds. Destroy traps cause damage to invaders, 
and also daze them. Capture traps hold invaders for a certain amount of time. 
Approaching the victim during this time initiates the capture sequence: if the 
green bar is depleted before the victim breaks free from the trap, he will be 
captured and his fate will be up to you. The time required to capture is reduced
by damaging the invader before attempting the capture. The character is immobile
and defenseless during capture attempts; however, the sequence can be broken off
by pressing triangle.
  For the purposes of defending against them, there are two types of traps: Atc.
and Mgc. The stats under the invader's Trait column pertain to Atc. and those 
under Magic are for Mgc. traps. The four defense stats, Agil, Def., Evade% and 
Wisdom range from 1 to 10 and presumably reduce the capture time, damage, chance
of getting caught, and confusion time of traps and monsters.

Rk (Rank)      overall effectiveness of the trap
Sz (Size)      space required to lay the trap, where the area is 2 x Sz for wall
               traps, or Sz x Sz for others
MP             cost in MP to lay a trap; this is not refunded for canceled traps
S% (Success%)  determines the chance that the trap will catch the invader and 
               not be dodged; this is not an actual percentage
HS (Hold sec.) number of seconds a capture trap holds an invader; this time is 
               reduced for stronger invaders
Pw (Power)     determines the damage that a destroy trap deals to the invader
CS (Conf.sec.) number of seconds a confused trap dazes an invader
Du (Duration)  number of times the trap can be engaged; when the duration 
               reaches 0 or the trap succeeds, the trap disappears

4) MONSTERS
  Monsters serve as a convenient, powerful, and reliable but costly supplement 
to traps in your arsenal against invaders. Monsters are constructed from the 
bodies of captured prisoners and require a number of block orbs to be summoned. 
Available monsters are listed in and called from the monster menu in the 
subscreen.
  Once called, they attack nearby enemies, either dealing damage or confusing 
them. (Unlike destroy traps, damage monsters do not daze their targets.) Monster
attacks may be either Battle (single target) or Area (all nearby targets). As 
with traps, monsters are classed as either Atc. or Mgc.
  Only one trap or monster may be active at once. Furthermore, monsters require 
a certain amount of space around the character to be summoned. The largest 
monster, the dragon, is so large that it can effectively be summoned only in the
entrance room. Monsters will fail to acquire their targets when space is cramped
or the invaders are too far away.
  Monsters gain experience whenever they perform a successful attack, and will 
rank-up when enough is accumulated. If the monster kills an invader, the monster
gets the experience instead of the character. This should be avoided, as the 
supply of invaders is limited, and defeating them is the only way for the 
character to gain experience points. Also beware that if the monster outranks

4.3) MONSTER DEVELOPMENT
  After chapter 6 you may begin imprisoning invaders and the develop menu 
becomes available. To imprison an invader, defeat him with a capture trap, 
choose the third option to keep the body, then drop it off at the upstairs or 
downstairs prison. Up to three bodies can be toted at once, indicated by coffin 
symbols, and the mission cannot end until all bodies are deposited.
  Each monster has the following body requirements:

Zombie      1 Cleric, 1 Soldier, 1 Pirate
Werewolf    1 Trap Pro, 1 Hunter, 2 Ninjas
Lami        2 Psychics, 2 Witches, 1 Messenger
Golem       1 General, 2 Cavaliers, 1 Fate Maker, 2 Merchants
Graviton    2 Diggers, 1 Alien
RedDragon   2 Generals, 3 Fate Makers, 2 Bomb Pros, 1 Sorcerer
Phantom     1 Wizard, 1 Cleric, 1 Archer
Foul        1 Magic Doll, 1 Pirate, 1 Ninja, 1 Carpenter

She-Death   This monster is not made through the development menu. To get 
            She-Death, take longer than 2:00 in the chapter 8 battle, then 
            choose the first dialog option at the end of the chapter.

5) ITEMS
  Items do not play a large role in this game. Useful items are sometimes 
dropped by defeated invaders, and some basic items can be bought from merchants,
but the only item which you will want to buy in large quantities is the block 
orb. To trade with a merchant, get close and press the X button. You may have to
avoid his attacks while doing this.

5.1) USABLE ITEMS

6) BONUSES

6.1) AVAILABLE BONUSES
  At the end of every chapter and body collecting session there is a bonus of MP
based on your performance. The bonuses are detailed below:

END OF INVADERS
GENOCIDE BONUS          400  x # of invaders, if all killed
CAPTURE BONUS           600  x # of invaders, if all captured
DYING CAPTURE BONUS     1000 x # of invaders, if all captured at low health (*1)
NO BONUS                0, if no invaders defeated or other combination

RESULTS OF PLAYER
Clear Time:
CLEAR TIME BONUS        720 x # of invaders - 2 x minutes elapsed (*2)

Trap Success rate:
NO BONUS                0, if no traps used successfully
PERCENT BONUS           1500 x trap success rate, if < 100% (*3)
PERFECT BONUS           3000, if 100%

Damage Point:
DAMAGE Point BONUS      1000 - 10 x damage taken, if hurt (*4)
NO DAMAGE BONUS         2500, if unhurt

Unused traps:
Trap repayment          Half value of unused traps (*5)

*1  If some invaders are captured when they are very weak, but others are 
captured strong, you still get the regular capture bonus. Consider the dying 
capture bonus an upgraded capture bonus. Typically it is hard to get with more 
than one invader.

*2  In order to get a time bonus, you must average less than 6 hours per 
invader.

*3  A trap is counted as a failure if the invader escapes the trap, or if it 
misses completely. The failure is still counted even if a subsequent attempt 
with the same trap succeeds. However, a capture trap that grabs the invader but 
fails to capture counts as a success.

*4  Damage taken is still counted against this bonus even if it is healed before
completing the battle.

*5  If an invader is killed by a destroy trap and the death ends the mission, 
that trap is counted as unused, because the animation was incomplete when the 
mission ended.

6.2) KILL OR CAPTURE?
  In every battle you must decide how to dispatch the invaders: either kill them
with destroy traps and monsters, or capture them with capture traps. By killing 
all or capturing all the invaders in a mission you recieve the genocide or 
capture bonus, respectively.
  The capture bonus is 1.5 times greater, but it is harder to achieve because 
capture traps have lower success rates and capturing leaves you vulnerable to 
other nearby invaders. Capturing gives you a choice between MP, gold, or (beyond
chapter 6) taking the victim prisoner. Most invaders leave about twice as much 
MP as gold; however, it should never be necessary to choose the MP over gold, 
because a competently played level should yield far more in MP bonuses than was 
spent laying traps. Thus there should be no real risk of runnning out of MP, 
leaving you free to focus on financing expensive monsters, should you choose.
  A dead invader only leaves gold, in the form of a moneybag. Moneybags must be 
picked up within 1 game hour; if killing the last invader ends the battle, you 
will have to seek out the bag at the beginning of the next chapter or body 
collecting session to get your money.
  If there are more than one or two invaders, it's better to go for the 
genocide bonus unless you want to keep the bodies. This is because trying to 
capture results in more failed traps, more time taken, and more damage taken, 
thus reducing the benefit of the capture bonus.
  The following summarizes the benefits of each choice:

Kill all
+ genocide bonus (400 each)
+ faster and easier
- cannot keep bodies
- inconvenient to get the last invader's gold

Capture all
+ capture bonus (600 or 1000 each)
+ can keep bodies
- failure-prone traps and greater risk of damage
- more time-consuming

Kill some, capture some
+ can keep bodies
+ use the most convenient method for each invader
- no bonus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) MASKS
  After chapter 1, masks are available to use from the menu. When activated for 
a nominal MP fee, masks may attract or repel invaders for a few seconds. This 
can be done to lure invaders into nearby traps, to chase them into traps farther
away, to clear out invaders that are blocking the path, to separate invaders to
deal with them singly, or to herd them together to hit them with area-effect 
monsters.
  In order for a mask to work, the invader must be close enough to hear it, and 
must be either alert or wandering dazed. Masks won't work if the invader is 
reeling from a hit (not moving) or in the process of dealing with a trap or 
monster. Invaders may break attack animation to react if the mask is used early 
enough. Even under the correct circumstances, masks often don't work. Simply 
retry until the effect is achieved.
  The table below shows the effect of all the masks on all of the standard 
invaders. A + or - signifies attraction or repulsion, and a . means that there 
is no effect. A ? means that I have observed both attraction and repulsion in 
different specimens of the same type. (I have assumed that the effect of the 
mask depends only on the invader type.)
  A + in the Default column indicates that invaders of this type tend to run 
toward the character without any encouragement. These are general cases; some 
invaders encountered during the chapters display different default behavior from
their generic counterparts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8) BODY COLLECTING
  After chapter 2, and after most chapters thereafter, you have the option of 
body collecting. This is an opportunity to battle more invaders in order to gain
experience, dropped items, and bodies to develop into monsters. When body 
collecting, you may attempt to lure up to six invaders. Up to four may arrive. 
(No more than four invaders may ever be present at once.)
  Some invaders are less likely to be lured than others, with the rarer types 
being harder to lure. If you are having trouble getting a particular invader to 
show up, try luring more than one of them, or change the order of invaders in 
the list.
  In order for an invader to be available to lure, at least one specimen of that
type must have been defeated before. This means that some invaders are not 
available until late in the game, and a couple (Messenger, Alien) would never be
available. However, luring certain combinations of two invaders incites a third 
to arrive:

Wizard    + Witch     = Sorcerer
Wizard    + Messenger = Sorcerer
Wizard    + General   = Messenger
Wizard    + Soldier   = Cleric
Gem Guard + Swordsman = Witch
Gem Guard + Witch     = Psychic
Cleric    + Messenger = Carpenter
Psychic   + MagicDoll = Alien
Trap Pro  + Ninja     = Bomb Pro
MagicDoll + Digger    = Alien
Soldier   + Archer    = Cavalier
Archer    + Merchant  = Digger
Pirate    + Merchant  = Carpenter
Pirate    + Ninja     = Trap Pro

  Since the maximum number of invaders is four, you must lure the two component 
invaders and no more than one other for the new invader to arrive. The order in 
which they are lured is insignificant, but if two valid combinations are present
among three invaders, you may not get the new invader that you wanted. All pairs
of invaders were tested, so this is all of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9) ENDINGS
  There are six endings. The one you see depends on the outcomes of three 
branching points in the story, one in chapter 8 and two just before the end. 
Although 2 x 2 x 2 = 8, there are only six endings because two are reused.
  The following table presents, without spoilers, the outcome of each path and 
shows the duplicates. The names of the endings were made up by myself.
