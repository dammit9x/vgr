1) WALKTHROUGH
  The essence of gameplay, like many beat-em-ups, is to fight through a sequence
of gangs and gang bosses. Certain events, such as beating a boss, have certain 
consequences, such as the appearance of other bosses. What makes "Downtown 
Special" unusual is that these events might occur on any of the play fields, 
which encompass all of feudal Japan.
  Gangs wander from region to region and may encounter KUNIO when they come to 
the same region. Gangs tend to seek out KUNIO, with the weaker gangs being the 
most persistent. Each region is connected to two or three other regions and an 
overview showing KUNIO and all the gangs can be seen by pressing B at the menu 
subscreen.
  The MAP CRSR item enables travel directly through the overview map. For a 
screenshot map of all the regions, check the website of "sprays":

2) ALLIES
  All allies share the same items and equipment but have different stats, TECHs 
and GROWTH. The default AI varies for each ally as well.
  Ally changes are performed at BUNZO'S, and some joining and leaving events 
also occur there. Only one event at BUNZO'S can be triggered per visit, so it is
possible for multiple events to stack up. KUNIO may need to enter BUNZO'S 
multiple times to clear them all.
  For an ally to leave, he must not be the active ally. Allies may therefore be 
prevented from leaving by keeping them active when they would try to leave.

Strangely, there seem to be two JUUKIs, because it is possible to get JUUKI to 
join both ways in the same game. It is even possible to get JUUKI to fight 
against himself by letting him leave the first way and join the second way.

3) MENUS
ITEMS
  Shows the character's inventory, where items can be consumed or equipped 
(USE), unequipped (REMOVE), transferred to the other character (GIVE), or 
discarded (DRP). Each character can hold up to 16 items. SELECT switches 
characters. The items carried and worn by the ally are shared by all allies. In 
a 2-player game, each character may only handle his own items.

STATUS
  Shows the character stats. SELECT switches characters. 

GROWTH
  Shows the rate at which each stat increases when the character levels up. 
Level-up occurs when a character knocks out 10 enemies and is indicated by a 
sound effect. KUNIO and his ally level up separately. Each 10% of growth 
increases VIT or STAM by 2, and other stats by 1. These rates are doubled if a 
DOUBLEUP is equipped. SELECT switches characters. In a 2-player game, each 
character may only manipulate his own growth.

TECH
  Shows all the TECHs known by the character. Press the A button to turn the 
selected TECH on or off. TECHs cannot be transferred. SELECT switches 
characters. In a 2-player game, each character may only select his own TECHs.

SAVE
  Enters the save game dialog. Choose SAVE, then confirm, to save the game 
progress. The game can be loaded by choosing the RESUME option at the power-on 
screen.

ALLY
  Set the computer-controlled ally's enemy targeting, aggressiveness, mobility, 
and weapon use.

SETTNG
  Displays miscellaneous game options:

  DIFFICULTY
Affects the enemies' stats. On the easier difficulties they have all zeros. 
The table below roughly shows the stats relative to medium difficulty.
    setting   EASY   ..   MED.   ..   HARD
   STAM/VIT    0     0     1x    3x   10x
other stats    0     0     1x    2x    5x

  MESSAGE SPEED
Affects both how fast text messages appear and how long they remain.
(Cutscene messages can always be skipped.)

  CURRENTS
Affects how fast weapons and characters are pushed around in water.

Press D to reveal more options:

  WATER EFFECTS
Determines how much of the CURRENTS setting is applied to characters.
setting    NO    SMLL    EX
 effect   none   half   full

  ATTACK BALANCE
Affects how much damage all characters take from attacks.
        setting   LOW   M L   MID   M H   HIGH
relative damage   5x   0.25x   1x    2x    5x
                   ^ not a typo

  DEFENSE BALANCE
Affects the ability of all characters to guard. 
Guarding is easiest on HIGH and useless on LOW.

  STAM BALANCE
Affects how much damage all characters take from attacks.
        setting    LOW    M L   MID    M H   HIGH
relative damage   +20%   +20%   +0%   -20%   -85%

  ENEMIES
Seems to have no effect. Either way you must defeat 10 enemies per gang.

SETUP
  Choose whether the game will be 1 PLAYER with a computer-controlled ally or 
2 PLAYER. The player may also switch control to the other character by pointing 
to the characters and pressing A.
  In MODE1 the characters cannot harm one another except with thrown weapons or 
by hitting unheld weapons. In MODE2, thr characters may harm one another with 
any attack.

MAP
  Press B on the menu subscreen to view the map. With a MAP CRSR equipped, the 
directional buttons move the cursor, and the A or start buttons move KUNIO to 
the selected region, while B cancels.

4) STATS

Author's note: The function of WILL, and especially DEF and STR, is poorly 
understood. If you know what these stats do, and can prove it, contact me.

PUNCH   determines the damage of punches and punch techs
KICK    determines the damage of kicks and kick techs
WPN     determines the damage of swung weapons and weapon techs
THROW   determines the damage of thrown weapons and throw techs
AGI     determines the walking and running speed
WILL    determines the jump height
DEF     determines the effectiveness of the guard move (?)
        and the damage of the DRILL tech
STR     determines the time an opponent can be held/mounted (?)
        and the damage of the STR techs

VIT and STAM:
  When the character is hit, STAM is reduced by the numbers shown. The lower the
character's STAM, the farther he flies when getting knocked off his feet.
  When STAM runs out and the character gets up after a fall, STAM increases by 
1/4 of the current VIT, and the current VIT is reduced by half.
  VIT cannot be damaged directly unless the character is lying down, or 
held/mounted while lying down.
  The character is not knocked out until both STAM and VIT are depleted, and the
character is on the ground.
  STAM is represented by the long bars, and VIT by the short bars.

  The maximum is 255 for VIT and STAM, and 127 for other stats.

  If a computer-controlled ally is knocked out, he is revived at the next 
screen, minus half his money. If the player-controlled character is knocked out 
in a 1-player game (or both in a 2-player game), both characters lose half their
money.

* These moves may damage the picked-up opponent by swinging him into weapons 
lying around, and may damage bystanders by hitting them with the picked-up 
opponent. The relevant stat is the same in either case.

WEAPONS
  Besides swinging and throwing them, weapons can be used by hitting them while 
they are on the ground. A weapon struck by any attack gets pushed away, and if 
it hits someone, the damage done is equal to the damage that would have occured 
if the attack had hit directly.

ATTACKING ON THE MOVE
  Attacks do more damage if performed while running or jumping. The table below 
roughly shows the amount of damage done relative to a standing or walking 
attack. This principle applies to TECHs as well.

movement:  standing   jumping   running   running jump
  damage:        1x        2x        3x        4x

(3) DEFLECT copies the appearance, TECHs and stats of the nearest character, 
    including the current STAM and VIT. The character reverts by using DEFLECT
    again.
(4) BIGBANG stuns all characters and does no damage.
(?) These techs seem to do fixed damage, independent of stats.

  TECHs known by bosses can be learned by defeating the boss while wearing the 
MASTER shades. Both KUNIO and the ally may learn if they both have shades.
  TECHs known by allies may only be copied to KUNIO if the boss NIZAE uses 
DEFLECT to copy the ally, and is then defeated in that form. Sometimes NIZAE 
uses DEFLECT on KUNIO instead, in which case the ally may learn KUNIO's TECHs. 
If NIZAE is defeated in his own form, only DEFLECT may be learned.

8) SHOPS

  INNs restore all STAM and VIT for one character for a fixed cost of 100. FOOD 
restores lost STAM and HEALER medicines restore lost VIT, with the amount 
restored equal to the cost of the item. Eat-in FOOD shops sell items are 
consumed immediately. In contrast, takeout FOOD and HEALER items are used from 
the inventory. 
  In regions with two TECH or ??? shops, the shops have been arbitrarily 
numbered to distinguish them. For the location of all ??? shops, check the map 
at http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/~sprays/fc/sprays.html and look for the yellow 
squares.

9) FAQ

Q) What should I buy?
A) If you are aiming to max out your character stats eventually, first get a 
DOUBLEUP for one of both characters. For collecting lots of TECHs, get one or 
two MASTER shades. To get through the game quickly, buy a MAP CRSR. To save cash
on future healing, buy MAGIC kimonos. To start out moderately, buy some 
equipment that boosts one of the offense stats and a couple TECHs that are based
on that stat. The 2xEFFECT is not worthwhile until your character is wearing 
lots of equipment.
  Nothing prevents you from buying whatever you want at the beginning, if you 
have the money from gambling. The shop with all of the special items, Rikuchuu 
??? shop 2, always seems to be closed at the beginning of the game, so you will 
have to run around to the other shops.

Q) How do I get money?
A) Either by mugging enemies or gambling. As for fighting, the MAGIC kimono is 
costly but will save money that would have to be spent healing STAM. Here is a 
little trick: if both KUNIO and the ally are standing over the enemy as he gives
up the coin, both will get the money.
  As for gambling, it's really the only way to afford the most expensive 
equipment. The chance of losing seems to be more than half, however.

Q) Why does it take so long to defeat enemies?
A) An enemy must run out of both STAM and VIT to be knocked out. He can't start 
losing VIT until he's flat on his back. Endlessly juggling the opponent doesn't 
defeat him any faster because it doesn't affect the VIT. Wait till he's done 
rolling, then attack.
  Only two enemies can be present at once, and the next one won't appear until 
the coin of the last one is gone.

Q) What's the fastest way though the game?
A) GINPA > ICHI & ROKU > HEIRU, TAME, KINSU, HEISI > JINRO > HAN > NIZAE > 
   TSUI & TATSU > TSUI or TATSU > ASAJI > HEISI > TORA > ASAJI

Q) Where's the KANPOU?
A) Get it from YONO (without a fight) at his second appearance. It doesn't show 
up in the ITEM menu.

Q) How do I control the ally?
A) Go to the SETUP menu, press D to point to the characters, and press A to 
switch. This is how to spend the ally's money at shops and heal him.

Q) Can I get all the allies?
A) Almost. You can get TATSU or TSUI but not both. You can only develop one at a
time though, so it's not helpful to get tham all.

Q) Can Kunio get all the techs?
A) No, not without cheating. M.SWING doesn't appear anywhere in the game. But 
all the techs besides M.SWING can be bought or learned with the MASTER shades.
  Two are tricky to get however. BIGBANG can be gotten from beating TSUU with 
the MASTER shades, if you get him to appear. If JUUKI appears beside the final 
boss, BMPKNART can likewise be learned from him, though the game is over at that
point. If TSUU or JUUKI is the ally in the NIZAE battle, it is possible to get 
their techs if NIZAE uses DEFLECT.

Q) Can I save the game or what?
A) This game's battery-backed save doesn't work properly with most emulators. 
The save/resume functionality may be preserved if saved within a savestate 
though.

Q) Where can I learn more about the English translation?
A) See here: http://www.romhacking.net/trans/226/

Q) What are the other Kunio games?
A) See these sites:

Q) What's the cheat code?
A) Go to the rename screen by pressing select at the SETUP menu. Change KUNIO's 
name to what would be "koganemushi" in the original ROM. This is done by 
entering J F X (sock) L. After entering the F, back up over it and enter the 
blank space over the - symbol. Done correctly, this adds 990,000 to both cash 
supplies and teaches all techs.
