  Little Ninja Brothers is an RPG spinoff of an arcade game called Chinese Hero.
The arcade game had an NES port called Super Chinese, or Kung-Fu Heroes, which 
has similar gameplay to the realtime battles of this game. The series is 
distinctive for its Chinese fantasy theme and whimsical character design, 
soundtrack and storytelling. There are several other RPG and fighting game 
titles in the series, most of which did not recieve English-language release.

[1] GAMEPLAY
 [1a] WALKABOUT MODE
  This mode is for adventuring between areas and interacting with characters. 
When walking around, some areas have no random encounters, some areas have 
realtime battles, and a few have turnbased battles.
  D-pad controls the characters. Button A brings up the menu. TALK starts a 
conversation with the NPC in front of the character. CALL is used two times in 
the story to bypass obstacles. SUB SCREEN brings up another menu where you can 
use items in the ITEM submenu or view various info under STATUS, EQUIP, 
TREASURE and PASSWORD. 

 [1b] REALTIME BATTLES
  These are initiated as random encounters or as a series of battles leading up 
to a boss fight. Enemies attack three and sometimes four at a time. Other 
enemies appear to replace those that are defeated or wander off. The battle ends
when a certain number of enemies, or the boss, have been defeated. For series 
battles, bring the characters to the exit door at the top of the screen to move 
on to the next.
  D-pad controls the characters. Button A attacks with PUNCH or SWORD. By 
default, PUNCH is equipped. If the character uses a T-STARS or SURGER item, this
attack also throws out a shuriken or surger attack. Button B while holding the 
D-pad does a flip kick: land on an enemy to attack it. The character can be 
steered with the D-pad while kicking. Button B without holding the D-pad does a 
straight up jump. During the jump, press the D-pad to do a dragon kick, which 
requires one "K" unit. The dragon kick has longer range and can damage some 
enemies that a regular kick can't.
  The START button or A and B together brings up a menu. Exit the menu with the 
B button. Go to EQUIPMENT to switch between PUNCH and SWORD weapons. If you have
six "M" units, MIGHTY BALL is also on the list. Use support items from the ITEM 
menu. If at least one shuriken type and one shuriken unit is available, T-STARS 
and SURGER also appear on the list. The name of the SURGER depends on the 
available shuriken types. (See [6a])
  Selecting MIGHTY BALL brings the "M" count to zero and causes a light colored 
"M" in a dark oval to appear on the playfield. Hit it to make the character 
invincible for a limited time. Non-boss enemies can be killed by touching them 
during this period. If the COMBINED CROSS attack has been acquired, touching the
other character allows the team to cover a bigger area and glide over obstacles.
(In a one-player game, the other character appears just for this purpose.)
  Most playfield have blocks lying around. Hitting these blocks can have various
random effects: The block may break, go flying off in the direction of the hit, 
or spawn a "?" ball. A flying block instantly kills weaker enemies. Punching a 
"?" ball reveals either an "M" (MIGHTY BALL) symbol or a skull. Three out of 16 
"?" balls are skulls: if 0x429 is 04, 09 or 0E, the next will be a skull.
  Most playfields also have hidden treasure chests. Hit the right place to 
reveal the chest, then hit to chest to get the contents. The locations and 
contents of the chests depend on the field. They are not random. The following 
table shows the possible contents and their effects. The ID is an identifier 
which is different for each item. (See [8])

+----------+----+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Item     | ID | Contents                    | Effect                         |
+----------+----+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+
| "?" ball | 02 | "M" ball                    | Add 1 to "M" stock             |
|          | 06 | Skull                       | Set "M" stock to zero          |
+----------+----+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Treasure | 16 | Dark skateboard, vertical   | Gain one SK-BOARD item         |
| chest    | 08 | Dark bomb with lit fuse     | Gain one BOO BOMB item         |
|          | 10 | Dark "K" on light rectangle | Add 5 dragon kicks to stock    |
|          | 20 | Dark shuriken on light oval | Add 1 T-STAR to stock          |
|          | 0C | Light shuriken on dark oval | Instant-use T-STAR, SINGLE type|
|          | 1C | Light heart                 | Instant full heal              |
+----------+----+-----------------------------+--------------------------------+

 [1c] TURNBASED BATTLES
  Some bosses and random encounters are fought this way. Enter commands for the 
next turn from the menu. Most attacks against the player hit, and most attacks 
against the enemy miss, but the SURGER, the SK-BOARD and healing items never 
fail. GUARD seems to have no effect, and RUN attempts to escape the battle.
  If the enemy is shaking from a BOO BOMB or FIXER, it cannot attack or dodge 
the players's attacks. If the enemy is blue from a MIGHTY BALL, it takes three 
times normal damage. The stun and MIGHTY BALL effects wear off randomly.
  Use CALL to summon the other character in a one-player game. He randomly uses 
PUNCH or KICK, but he will mimic a DRAGON KICK or SWORD attack from the player.

 [1d] MINIGAMES
  The minigames pit the two characters to race to a finish line, sometimes with 
other objectives as well. In a one-player game, the other character is 
controlled by the computer. The games can also be accessed at the main game 
menu, as FIELD MEETING, and crop up at a few points in the story. They are all 
optional, but most have good rewards. 
  Mash the A button while holding the D-pad to run. However, it's easier to move
with kicks or dragon kicks, which are performed in the usual way. Press button A
without the D-pad to punch. In shooting games, this also throws a shuriken. Some
of the fields have water traps and rolling logs to avoid.

[3] EXPERIENCE LEVEL TABLE
  Gain experience (EX) by winning realtime or turnbased battles. If enough EX is
earned, the characters level up at the end of the battle. Experience level 
determines the MAX LIFE and ATTACK power of the characters. (ATTACK is equal to 
LEVEL.)
  The EX reward is determined by the enemy group, but the level of the group is 
irrelevant. The actual enemies defeated don't affect the EX reward, except for 
Uni-Gon. (Each Uni-Gon, either the strong or weak type, gives an additional 20 
points.) Killing enemies with the sword incurs a penalty to the EX reward if the
enemies can be hit by punches.
  The EX required to reach the next level is given on the following table, and 
can be checked at convenience stores or the game over menu.

[5] EQUIPMENT AND ITEM TABLE
  The following table shows all the equipment and items in the game. The entries
that are not found during normal gameplay are marked with a * symbol.
  The buy value is the amount of SEN needed to get the item, and the sell value 
is the amount of SEN you get back on a trade-in. They are --- if the item can't 
be bought or traded in.
  In all cases, the benefits of lesser equipment also applies to better 
equipment. For example, a FIRE SHIELD gives the protection of the MIRROR SHIELD.

[6] BATTLE DAMAGE TABLE
  The table below shows the damage done to the enemy by various attacks. Damage 
depends mostly on the ATTACK stat, which is equal to experience level, and the 
damage bonus from the PUNCH equipment, listed in the item table.

 [6a] SURGER DAMAGE TABLE
  T-STARS and SURGER require a shuriken item to use. In realtime battles, they 
give special power for a limited time and can be used repeatedly. In turnbased 
battles, they are consumed in the next turn. The SURGER available depends on the
highest level shuriken type available.
