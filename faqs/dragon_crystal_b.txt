1. How to play
  Dragon Crystal is a Rogue-style game: a turn-based crawl through 30 randomly 
generated dungeons (floors), each one harder than the last. The hero must find 
food and money to survive, and collect and identify equipment in order to fight 
the monsters that get in his way. His ultimate goal is to find the crystal ball 
on the 30th floor to escape his curse. Along the way he is followed by a 
mysterious dragon that hatches from a giant egg.
  The differences between the Game Gear (GG) and Sega Master System (SMS) 
versions are largely cosmetic. This guide explains the differences in detail.

1a. Controls
Direction pad moves the character or attacks enemies by running into them.
Button 1/A goes to the subscreen where you can change equipment or use items.
Button 2/B picks up items underfoot, and also waits for time to pass.
Start button, when pressed, toggles fast/slow animation in the SMS version.
Start button, while held down, makes slow animation fast in the GG version.

1b. Subscreen
  Press Button 1/A to toggle the subscreen. Here you can see the basic character
parameters (floor, rank, HP, PW, AC, money) and use items. See section 2 for 
details on parameters. 
  There is one submenu for each item type: Swords, Armor, Scrolls (SMS) or Books
(GG), Rods, Potions and Rings. Press button 2 to choose items and commands. 
Swords, Armor, and Rings are worn with the Equip command and change the 
character parameters. Sometimes equipment is cursed, and is impossible to take 
off without a Bless scoll/book. Cursed weapons and armor give no bonus to PW or 
AC, and cursed rings have other nasty effects. There is no way to tell a cursed 
weapon or armor without first equipping it.
  Scrolls/Books, Rods and Potions are consumed by the Use command. These are 
support items and perform such functions as healing and upgrading equipment. 
Some items have undesirable effects though. See section 4 for details. 
  All items can also be dropped (provided there's room at the feet) or thrown. 
Throwing things at monsters either does a small amount of damage or has some 
other effect, such as "boggling" them. Thrown items sometimes miss the target. 
In any case, thrown items are always lost, and dropped items are always 
preserved. 
  All items other than weapons and armor start out unidentified. They will have 
unhelpful descriptions such as "Mauve Potion." These labels will be different 
every game. There are two ways to find out what they are. The riskier way is to 
use them. The less risky way is to throw them. The thrown item doesn't actually 
have to hit anything. In any case, any item of the same type that is 
encountered again will be identified.

1c. Time
  Time is divided into increments known as ticks. Moving, attacking, picking 
up items and using items all take one tick. During this time, monsters move and 
attack, food is consumed and natural healing occurs. Status ailments other than 
Sluggishness wear off over time. Changing equipment and dropping items takes no 
time, however.
  You can choose to do nothing and let time pass by pressing button 2/B. There 
are several reasons to do this: You can try to get monsters to move into a 
position where you can shoot them with rods or throw things at them; you can 
wait repeatedly in front of a wall to search for a hidden passage; Or you can 
wait for a dangerous ailment to wear off before proceeding.

1d. Food and eating
  You need food to survive. Pick up bread for about 20 food units and meat for 
about 40. The maximum that can be carried is 99. Once every 10 ticks a unit of 
food is consumed, and once every 8 ticks HP is restored by an amount equal to 
the current level. These values can be changed by equipping certain rings. If 
you run out of food, healing stops and HP is consumed instead of food, 
eventually resulting in starvation.

1e. Dying and continuing
  If you get killed, you will be shown a summary of your performance and may 
have the opportunity to continue, provided you have enough money. When you 
continue you lose all items except the equipped weapon and armor. The 
character's level and other parameters are unchanged, except for the gold paid 
to continue. Identified items stay identified. You may continue up to three 
times, for a total of four lives.

1f. Objective
  Your goal on floors 1-29 is to find the exit to the next floor. This is 
always located in the vertical wall of a room, often at a corner. It's never on 
the edge of the map though.
  On floor 30 there is no exit. Instead you need to find and pick up the 
crystal ball. Picking it up ends the game. Your final goal will be easier if 
you prepare by clearing out each floor fully, getting all the treasure and 
slaying all the monsters for experience.


2. Character parameters

FL: The current Floor, besides indicating how far along the game you are, 
determines the monsters present, the items available, and the cost of 
continuing at death. At floors 11 and 21, the background music changes. See 
section 6 for details.

Exp: This is the total experience points earned from killing monsters. Kill 
monsters to gain exp and level-up. Note that Exp cannot be normally be seen 
during gameplay.

Level and Rank: The character increases in level as he gains exp. The level 
determines his rank, the healing rate, the damage done by rods, and the 
development of the dragon companion. Each level-up gives a bonus to base PW and 
max HP. It's also possible to lose levels from certain items and monsters. In 
this case max HP is lost but there is no PW loss. You can't see the level 
directly but you can figure it out from the Rank. See section 3 for more info.

HP: The character's health. The right number is the maximum and the left is the 
current amount. It goes down as monsters hit you; when it's 0 you die. The 
character normally heals damage over time. You can also drink healing potions. 
The max HP is increased by leveling up. It can also be decreased by leveling 
down or getting hit by the tree enemies. The formulas for max HP gain and loss 
are as follows:

Max HP gained at level up = (New level + Floor) x 2

Max HP lost at level down = Old level + Floor

PW: The power of your attack. A higher number will result in more damage. This 
is primarily determined by your weapon. Certain items can increase this 
temporarily or permanently. Leveling up also gives a bonus to your PW. Likewise 
it can be decreased by the Wither potion, and certain Snail enemies.

AC: This is the measure of your defense. A higher number will result in less 
damage taken. It is determined by your armor and like PW can be raised by items.
Unlike PW, however, it does not increase with level-ups, and the base AC can 
never go down.

Hit: Determines the hit rate of your attack. A higher number results in fewer 
misses, though it is not a percentage. This parameter is not directly 
observable in the game, and is solely dependent on the weapon.

Evd: Determines how often you dodge enemy attacks. A higher number results in 
more dodging, but it's not a percentage. Like Hit, this can't be observed 
directly and depends only on the armor.

F: This is the current food supply. Maximum is 99.

G: This is the amount of money carried. It's used to buy continues after death.

Window color: The color of the windows and text indicates the character's basic 
condition.
  White: normal
  Blue: poisoned
  Yellow: out of food
  Throbbing red: HP is at <25%

Status ailments: Status problems can be caused by certain potions or by the 
attack of certain enemies. All status ailments can be cured by advancing to the 
next floor.
  Paralyzed: The character can't do anything. Time automatically advances until 
it wears off. Caused only by a Freeze potion.
  Sluggish: The character takes twice as long to do anything. The only way to 
inflict is with a Slow potion. Can be cured with a rare Slowfix potion. 
Drinking a Slow potion typically proves to be a fatal mistake.
  Poisoned: Healing stops, but it doesn't hurt you. Caused by frog enemies. It 
wears off with time, or use a Cure potion.
  Fog: Vision is restricted to the adjacent tiles and fog persists outside this 
area. The explored areas become forgotten.  Caused by a Fog potion or the Mad 
Witch/Sorcerer monster. It wears off with time, or use a Cure potion.
  Dizzy: The character moves in random directions. The ability to use and throw 
items is unaffected though. Caused by a Daze potion, and by many enemies. It 
wears off with time, or use a Cure potion.

4g. In-game messages
  A message in the game is given whenever you use an item. The message can be 
useful for figuring out what the item was that you just used, if it wasn't 
identified. If the item is used under circumstances that cause it to do 
nothing, such as pointing a rod at a wall, the message will instead report that 
nothing happened. Remember that the item type is identified for future 
reference in any case. The message is different for the GG and SMS versions.

7. Gameplay tips
  On the early floors, use or throw everything you find in order to identify 
as much as possible. You have little to lose if something goes wrong.

  The game gets harder as you go down floors. For this reason, you should play 
safer on the later floors: don't use strange items on yourself (especially 
potions) and don't wear new equipment unless a Bless scroll is handy. Drinking 
a Wither potion on the later floors will ruin your character.

  Try to clear every floor. If you skip floors the end of the game will be much 
harder. If you fight every battle you won't have to worry about running from 
strong monsters, and you should reach level 16 by the end of the game. 

  Throw useless or harmful items at monsters. For example, the Freeze potion 
paralyzes the target. Monsters will try to avoid letting you set up a throw, 
however.

  Obviously, you should collect items that will help in difficult situations. 
When your hands are full you can drop something and pick it up again if you 
change your mind.

  Most of the rings are useful, but the best rings are the Ogre ring for 
fighting and the Food ring for exploring.

  Focus on offense. In other words, try to kill the enemy in as few ticks as 
possible. Most monsters either have crippling added effects or strong attacks 
which you really can't defend against.

  The dragon doesn't actually do anything for you, other than occupy the space 
behind you. This helps to avoid being attacked from behind.

  Try to collect each of the blue swords if you can. If you have the correct 
blue sword for a monster, always use it. It's better than any other weapon. 
Don't even try attacking orbs/mysts without the right blue sword.

  The Death blade and the Blood sword complement one another well.

  Figure out where the hidden passages are. They are always revealed by 
searching horizonally, never vertically. On later floors you may be forced to 
find passages to proceed. You will learn the layouts eventually.

  The eyeball enemies can ruin your equipment. While Norust scrolls and Mystic 
armor will help against the blue eyeball, there is no defense against the 
weapon rust of the red eyeball. However, since eyes move slow, it shouldn't be 
a problem. Remember: Never let the red eyeball get an attack on you.

  The blue and red ooze-type monsters sometimes divide instead of attacking. 
Since they are very weak, you can exploit this for easy exp by waiting for them 
to split and then harvesting them. The total amount of exp you can get from 
this is not high, but it's enough to make a difference on the early floors.

  It's possible to lose levels by using a Wither Rod or getting hit by a King 
snail. Since the amount of MHP lost at level down is less than MHP gained at 
level-up, and no PW is lost, you'll come out stronger by completing the round 
trip.
  When leveling down, exp is reduced to the minimum amount needed to reach the 
previous level. So if a level 7 character is brought down a level, his exp is 
set to 340. Since the exp required is much bigger at high levels, it's better 
to try this at low levels.


8. Hacking table
  The following table lists the addresses in RAM where key variables are stored.
Edit the contents of these addresses directly to manipulate the game. Or, use 
this information to make Game Genie or PAR codes. Use the ID numbers given in 
section 4 to place specific items for C900-C92F.
  Unless otherwise specified, enter all values in hexadecimal. Multi-byte 
quantities such as money need to be entered in reverse order (smaller digits 
first). If you don't understand, search for a guide on basic hexadecimal 
concepts.
  If you try to put the game in an impossible state, such as placing a rod in 
your potion list, the game is very likely to freeze up. Use common sense.
