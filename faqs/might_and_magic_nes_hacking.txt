2. ADDRESSES

  The following tables list the addresses in RAM where key variables are stored.
Edit the value of these addresses directly to manipulate the game. Or, use this 
information to make Game Genie codes. 

009F  X coordinate
00A0  Y coordinate

For the following, add (0x0001 * #) to reach the desired character:

0308  GEMS share
0318  GOLD share
0328  FOOD share

A character's share is the weighting given to that character when distributing 
goods in the camp menu. Normally it is set from 1-3.

For item addresses, the value is the item ID. Match up the IDs with the items 
using ASchultz's FAQ/Walkthrough on gamefaqs. He gives a table of items. The IDs
aren't shown, but the items are listed in order from 01 to FF, except for the 
blank space, which is 00.


3. ITEM GLITCH

  The item IDs are also important for exploiting the item glitch. To perform the
glitch, go to the use item menu and press B on an empty space in player 1's 
equipped item list when his backpack is full. The ID of the last backpack item 
is reduced by 1. Use this in conjuction with the item table to get any item.

To see the glitch in action, as well as a fast play-through of the game, watch 
my TAS (tool-assisted speedrun) on NESvideos:
