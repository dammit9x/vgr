You are shivering in the cold night air of an English churchyard, unsure of the forces that are driving you on this night of destiny. Here among the gravestones, the most famous sword in all England grows out of a large, oddly-shaped rock. A shaft of moonlight falls upon the magic runes that shimmer in the polished steel:

WHOSO PULLETH OUT THIS SWORD OF THIS STONE, IS RIGHTWISE KING BORN OF ALL ENGLAND.

The local chieftain, King Lot, has declared a curfew, and you know that even a boy such as yourself would be thrown in prison should you be caught by his soldiers. Yet you have come anyway, irresistibly drawn by this sword of mystery. Noblemen from far and wide have tried and failed to draw the sword from the stone, yet something inside urges you to try.

Slowly you approach the sword. Driven by some inner force, you clasp your hand around the hilt. The two seem made for one another. You pull. Nothing happens. You strain harder. The sword gives a little, and then....
Merlin appears before you and his voice thunders in your ears, "Listen well, Arthur, for now will the mysteries of your childhood be made clear to you. Your true father was Uther Pendragon, High King of England. Your mother was Ygraine of Cornwall. When you were born, you were given to me to raise and keep safe until such time as England had need of you."

"To you alone belongs the throne of England, Arthur. But the time is not yet when you may take up this sword. Before you gain your birthright, you must prove yourself a king. To rule England, you must be both wise and chivalrous. To lead her armies, you must be strong and courageous. I believe you have these qualities within you, but you must demonstrate them for all to see. In so doing, you will gain the experience you need to claim the sword."

"Come seek me out at my cave beyond the meadow, and I will help you achieve your quest. Be warned, however, that another plots to steal your throne. Go, therefore, son of Uther, to earn and protect that which is yours."
Merlin disappears as suddenly as he came. In the space where he had been, a torque hangs in mid-air for a second and then falls to the ground.

>WEAR IT
[You take the torque first.]
You put on the torque.

CHURCH

You walk up the steps and into the church. It is a simple, one-room building with only a few rough-hewn wooden benches facing an altar. The only exit is to the west.

>PRAY
As is your knightly duty, you bow your head in silent prayer and ask for guidance in your quest.

[You have earned ten chivalry points.]

>W
CHURCHYARD

You return to the churchyard. At the foot of the church steps is a large stone with a jewelled sword protruding from it. The church entrance lies to the east, and just west of you is a large gravestone. A stone wall encircles the churchyard, but there is an ironwork gate in the wall to your south.

>GIVE GLASS TO IDIOT
"Oooh look! A red piece of glass!" The idiot takes the red piece of glass and gives you the dead mouse.

>THANK IDIOT
The idiot smiles brightly and says, "OK."

[You have earned ten chivalry points.]

From down the street you hear the sound of approaching voices. It sounds like soldiers. Suddenly, you remember the curfew.

>HIDE BEHIND STONE
[The gravestone]
You jump behind the gravestone and cower low to the ground. The churchyard lies to the east.

You hear steps outside the gate and see moonlight glinting off soldiers' helmets. A voice calls out, "Search the church."

>Z
Time passes...

In the distance, you hear the sound of the bells calling the monks to prayer.

The gate creaks as it swings open. Peering around the base of the stone, you see a group of soldiers enter the churchyard. Two of them disappear briefly into the church. They report back to their captain, who gives the all-clear signal to someone waiting outside the gate.

Suddenly, the evil King Lot strides through the gate, followed by four soldiers wheeling a sturdy cart. "There it is!" Lot snaps, gesturing angrily at the stone. "Load it up. Quickly!" The soldiers gather around the stone and strain against its massive weight. They tilt it up, and then slide the cart beneath it.

"One of you stay here," Lot commands. "Let no one enter until we return in the morning. The rest of you, follow me." Lot turns and marches out of the churchyard, followed at a distance by the men pushing the heavy cart. One soldier remains behind to guard the gate.

Do you want to continue waiting?
Please answer YES or NO>N

>SLEEP
Despite the excitement of the evening, you soon fall asleep.

Hours later you are awakened by the sound of the church bell ringing. A crowd is gathering in the churchyard, and King Lot is standing on the steps of the church. Above his head, he brandishes a jewelled sword that looks exactly like the sword that was imbedded in the stone.

"See," he shouts, "I have the magic sword! I had a vision that told me to come here at midnight. When I arrived, the stone was surrounded by angels. They told me that Uther's son was dead and that I was to be the new High King. Humbly, I grasped the sword and lo, it came up into my hand. Suddenly there came a beam of bright light and a rush of wind. Despite its great weight, the stone was miraculously drawn up by the beam, and it disappeared into heaven!"

"Three days hence - at noon on Christmas day - I shall be coronated on this very spot. If any man dares to contest my claim, let him come to my hall and challenge me in the traditional manner of knighthood, and I will do battle with him."

At this last pronouncement, the crowd cheers and rushes toward Lot. His guards clear a path for him to the church gate, and he leaves the churchyard in triumph, surrounded by the cheering mob. Soon no one is left nearby, and once again you find yourself alone.

>EXIT
You step out from behind the gravestone.

>S
TOWN SQUARE

You walk into the town square. The churchyard lies to the north, and the castle to the east. To your south you see the entrance to the town's only tavern, and to the west is the village green.

The village idiot is here, idly playing with a red piece of glass that lies at his feet.

>W
VILLAGE GREEN

You enter the village green, which is a common area just inside the town's western defenses. The old Roman wall is crumbling into disrepair here, and there is a gaping hole where the west gate used to be. The town square lies to the east, and an ancient oak dominates the center of the green, towering over its roots like an aging druid over a group of prostrated initiates.

>W
OUTSIDE TOWN GATE

You leave the town and pause outside the town gate, which lies to the east. A road leads to the north, and to the southwest is a meadow.

>SW
MEADOW

You come to a meadow. Paths lead off to the northeast, northwest, and southeast.

You hear the thunder of approaching hooves, but see nothing. Moments later you feel ghostly fingers pluck at your clothing, and everything you were carrying suddenly disappears. You hear a ghostly chuckle, and then the hoofbeats recede once again to the east.

>NW
PATH

As you leave the meadow, the path begins to wind up a hill that overlooks the town. Hundreds of tiny midges are buzzing around your ankles.

>NW
OUTSIDE MERLIN'S CAVE

The path ends in the clearing just south of Merlin's cave. An old man is sitting on a rock outside the cave, reading a scroll. A minute passes before you realize that this shabbily-dressed hermit is the same awe-inspiring Merlin who appeared to you in the churchyard.

Merlin looks up and says, "Why hello, Arthur. I was just thinking about you." He strokes his beard meditatively. "I wish to help you, but if I give you magic spells that instantly fulfill your every desire, you will only prove that any man so favoured can accomplish a quest. Instead, I've been pondering the idea of allowing you to assume shapes other than your human form."

"You see, as an animal, you could do things that humans can't. But at least these things would not be done for you by spells. You would still have to demonstrate the qualities which prove your worthiness to rule - and at the same time you would be gaining respect for all forms of life."

His dark eyes bore into you for a second and then he seems to reach a decision. "Yes. That is what we shall do." He glances down at the scroll. "The creatures here should be sufficient for our purpose. The owl, the badger, the salamander, the eel, and the turtle."

Merlin waves his hand over you and mumbles a few words. "There. It is done. The word you will need is 'Cyr,' the ancient word of transformation. When you wish to become another creature, say 'Cyr' and the name of that creature. Remember, however, that the people fear sorcery - if someone is present when you change form, he may kill you. Remember also that you cannot move directly from one foreign shape to another. You must become human first."

>N
CRYSTAL CAVE

Your heart thumps with anticipation as you edge into the mysterious cave of which you have heard so much. The walls here seem to shimmer with their own light. The ceiling is lost in the darkness overhead. You hear the sound of distant music, as if the earth itself were singing - and then the chord dies away and you are left in silence.

In the center of the room is a perfectly round crystal ball. On the ground near the wall is a bag.

>GET BAG
You take the bag.

>S
OUTSIDE MERLIN'S CAVE

You blink your eyes as you emerge from the darkness of the cave into the sunshine.

Merlin is here.

Merlin glances up from his scroll and gives you a look of mild reproval. "Be on your way, Arthur - you have much to do. Even as we speak, a prisoner languishes unjustly in a cell below Lot's castle. If you wish to be England's king, you must help England's people."

Your stomach makes grumbling noises.

>S
TAVERN

You enter the gloomy, smoke-filled tavern. Despite the early hour, some farmers are hunched around the fire in conspiratorial conversation. They look up in alarm when you come in, then return to their conversation when they see only a boy.

The tavern's kitchen is to the south.

>S
TAVERN KITCHEN

The kitchen is dominated by a mean-looking cook who is working at a table with his back to a closed cupboard. Above his head is a beautiful caged bird who starts to chatter as soon as you come in. Near the edge of the table is a small, stale piece of cheese.

The cook takes a backhanded swipe at the bird and mutters, "Sharrup."

The cook leaves the room in response to a shout from a thirsty customer.

You feel yourself becoming smaller. Your feet become talons, your arms become wings, your eyes are suddenly sharper. You are no longer wearing anything, and your entire body is covered with feathers.

In my country we would 'ave 'im killed. But ee 'as some spices 'idden away in ze cupboard, and ze key to ze cupboard ees 'idden in ze thatch. Queekly now, before ze sadist returns.

Poof! You regain your human form.

Everything you were wearing magically reappears in its place.

>OPEN CAGE
The bird flies up and disappears into the thatch of the roof. Moments later, a key falls to the floor. The bird pokes his head out of the thatch, leaves a small present on the table for the cook, and then flies out the door.

TAVERN

You go back into the gloomy, smoke-filled tavern. Despite the early hour, some farmers are hunched around the fire in conspiratorial conversation. They look up in alarm when you come in, then return to their conversation when they see only a boy.

The tavern's kitchen is to the south.

A large farmer says, "I'll believe in 'is tale of angels when me billy goat stands up on 'is 'ind legs and calls me Chauncey."

DEN

You burrow down into the cold earth. After a while, the tunnel broadens out into a comfortable badger's den that nestles up against the castle wall to the east. The stones in the wall look very old, and the mortar around one in particular is cracked and crumbling. Some sunlight filters down from the opening over your head, and another tunnel leads away to the south.

THORNEY ISLAND

You poke your head out of the badger hole and look around. Seeing no one, you crawl out of the hole and find yourself deep within the confines of a hawthorn bush on a small, foggy island. The thorny branches of the bush form an impenetrable barrier on all sides.

On the ground is a thorny sprig that has fallen from the bush.

You push on the stone. It wobbles. You give it another push and it falls into the room beyond!

>E
CELL

You crawl through the hole in the wall and plop to the ground on the other side. You find yourself in a dank, cramped cell far below Lot's castle. The room was originally used by the Romans for food storage, but someone converted it into a miserable dungeon by bolting chains to the clammy stone walls.

There is a cell door of stout wood to the north, and a hole in the wall to the west where a stone has been pushed out. A prisoner is chained to the wall.

You see a building stone here.

[You have earned two wisdom points and two quest points.]

>CYR BOY
Poof! You regain your human form.

The prisoner cowers against the wall. One of his hands makes the sign against evil magic, and he says, "Take pity on me, oh enchanted one. I am but a humble craftsman who was commissioned by the King to fashion a sword after the enchanted sword in the stone. No sooner had I complied with his request but he threw me in the dungeon."

>GET ROCK
You take the building stone.

>YELL
You call out. Moments later, you hear footsteps in the hall outside the door.

>HIDE BEHIND DOOR
You flatten yourself up against the cold stone wall.

You hear keys fumbling in the lock, and then the door swings back and a guard steps into the cell. He stands for a moment with his back to you, looking at the prisoner.

>HIT GUARD WITH ROCK
You step out from behind the cell door and bean the guard with the stone. It puts a dent in his helmet and he slumps to the floor, unconscious. As he falls, you notice a key dangling at his side.

You are at the end of an underground corridor that runs east and west. To the east is a small chamber.

The prisoner follows you.

>E
SMALL CHAMBER

You are in a small chamber that looks oddly out of place in this underground prison. Its rich furnishings include a fine stonework floor, comfortable chairs, and a beautifully woven tapestry on the wall. It looks like a king's secret consultation chamber.

The prisoner follows you.

Behind the tapestry is a dark passage.

You are in a dark underground passageway whose walls have been carved out of solid rock. You peer into the darkness and discover a secret passage leading upward to both the north and south. To the west is the back of a tapestry.

The passage widens out and becomes a small room. A tapestry covers the west wall and a dark passage leads down to the south. You hear someone talking on the other side of the tapestry, and after a few moments you realize you are in a secret room directly behind King Lot's throne in the Great Hall.

The prisoner follows you.

You scamper through the flames unharmed and are now in the castle's kitchen. It is a huge stone room with a cavernous fireplace along the east wall. There is a door in the northwest corner of the room. On the floor next to a nearby table you see a barrel.

On the kitchen table you see a pumice stone.

You strain against the barrel. It teeters for a moment, but then finally crashes over on its side, sending a flood of water directly onto the blaze. The roar of the fire disappears in a loud hiss, and a huge cloud of steam pours out of the fireplace. When the steam clears, you see that the fire has gone out. The prisoner steps through to join you in the kitchen.

OUTSIDE CASTLE GATE

You walk outside the gate to the castle of evil King Lot. A soldier is standing guard. To the south is the village smithy.

The smith pulls you out of earshot of the guard and whispers, "I am grateful to you for freeing me, kind sir. I dare no longer stay in this town for fear of being recaptured by King Lot. But as thanks for freeing me, I will tell you where I have hidden another sword. It is plain, unlike Lot's sword, but it is of the best quality. It is hidden under the roots of the oak tree in the village green. Goodbye, sir. And thank you again."

The smith walks off toward the town gate and quickly disappears from sight.

EDGE OF WOODS

You come to the edge of the woods, where you see a knight's pavilion decked out in blue. A curved horn is hanging from the branches of one of the trees, and a large horse is tied to another. The path continues north into the woods, and south towards the town.

>KNOCK ON DOOR
The door to the pavilion opens and a knight with a bushy white mustache and splendid side-whiskers emerges. "I say, frightfully kind of you to knock. Most people just start to blow away on that beastly horn. I suppose you're here to joust?" He looks you up and down. "Splendid. I see you are a gentleman and prefer to joust without a helmet. Let's have at it then."

The knight disappears into the pavilion for a moment and then emerges carrying two lances that are identical save that one is red and one is green. "Mount up, lad," says the knight, "and I shall give you your choice of lances."

>MOUNT
You are now on the horse. "Jolly good," says the knight. "Which lance would you like, the red one or the green one?"

>RED
You take the red lance. The knight keeps the green one and fetches his horse from behind the pavilion. He unties your horse, which canters a little distance away and then turns to face the blue knight. After a moment's hesitation the two well-trained horses start to gallop towards one another.

The knight shields his head and aims his lance at your head.

Do you want to shield your (1) head, (2) body, or (3) leg?
>1
Do you want to aim your lance at his (1) head, (2) body, (3) leg, or (4) horse?

You shield your body and aim your lance at his body. The knight shields his body and aims his lance at your body. The blue knight crashes to the turf. You try to stay upright on the horse, but seconds later you, too, hit the ground. "Well struck, lad!" the knight cries out. "And by virtue of the fact that I was the first to be unseated, you are declared the winner." After a few moments he staggers to his feet and disappears into the pavilion. He emerges moments later with an ivory key, which he hands to you.

"Congratulations, old chap. Spoils of war, what?"

The knight stumbles around the clearing, cleaning up after the joust. He ties the horse to the tree, collects the lances and disappears into the pavilion.

You put the peat on the coals. It catches fire quickly, and soon the room is filled with warmth.

After a few moments, the peasant begins to stir. When he is fully conscious he sits up and looks from the fire to you. "Why, God bless you, sir," he says. "There's not many would take pity on a poor man who makes his living in a peat bog."

EAST OF FORD

You land alongside a river. You see the gnarled and wasted remains of tree here, and from one of its branches hangs a withered old apple. To the northeast, the land looks bleak and barren. The road leading in that direction looks like it ends at the foot of a forbidding mountain range. The ford across the river lies to the west.

But what I can give ye is this jug of home-brewed whisky, which to any drinkin' man is worth more than gold itself." He produces a jug and gives it to you.

ENCHANTED FOREST

You follow the road into the gloom of the enchanted forest. It is dark, mysterious and unnaturally quiet. The trees loom up at you as you pass by. Their branches seem to reach out and pluck at you, as if they resent human presence. Paths disappear into the forest to the northeast, northwest, and north.

You are at the end of a causeway which is guarded by a red knight. The causeway leads south across the lake to an island. The Field of Honor lies to the west.

The red knight stands at attention before you, staring off into the distance. He acknowleges your presence enough to say, "You shall get no further unless you bring me the egg of a giant raven, the hair that grows between the eyes of a dragon, the tusk of the wild boar that stalks the enchanted forest, and the Golden Fleece of the evil demon Nudd."

Everything you are carrying falls to the bottom. Fortunately, it doesn't look as if the water will cause any damage. Your body gets smaller, and your arms and legs disappear.

BASILISK'S LAIR

The tunnel widens out into a chamber full of grotesque statues. Upon closer examination, you realize with horror that they are knights who have been turned into stone. The tunnel takes a turn to the northeast, but the passage into the mountain is blocked by a sleeping basilisk.

The noise of your entry awakens the basilisk, who begins to cast around bleary-eyed for the source of the sound.

>HIDE BEHIND SHIELD
The glint of the highly-polished shield attracts the basilisk's attention. Slowly it turns its head towards you, and then suddenly it catches a glimpse of its own reflection. The life immediately drains out of the creature, and you realize with fascination that it has turned itself into stone.

ICE ROOM

The tunnel broadens out to a frigid room whose walls are lined with ice. It is so cold that your breath freezes as soon as it comes out of your mouth - whereupon it falls to the ground and shatters.

The cold begins to creep into your bones.

The words freeze into a block of ice as soon as they come out of your mouth. It hangs in the air for a second before it starts to fall.

Your blood is warming up.

The block is rapidly shrinking.

>NE
HOT ROOM

You enter a room that is unbearably hot. There is a closed door directly to the north. The door has a face in it.

The face smiles at you for a moment and then says, "Welcome to the Hall of the Demon. Entry to the hall is simple. All you have to do is tell me the password. I'll even make it simple for you. The password is the name of the demon who rules within. I'll even tell you his name. It's Nudd."

All the while he speaks, you get hotter and hotter. You begin to feel very uncomfortable, and your throat becomes parched and dry.

The heat begins to make you sweat.

The block of ice melts completely, and "Nudd" rings out loud and clear. The face in the door smiles and says, "Yes. That's it. Very good. Now you may enter."

The door swings open and you walk through. It closes behind you with an ominous "clank."

HALL

You have entered a long, narrow banqueting hall that is panelled in dark walnut. High above you, the walls are lined with the shields of vanquished knights. At the far end is a golden throne, upon which sits a beautiful girl. As you walk the length of the hall, you see that the girl's wrists are manacled to the throne, and that she is sitting on a Golden Fleece.

The girl's image seems to shimmer for a second, and then she says, "Oh kind sir, I have been imprisoned by the evil demon who rules this place. But if you release me, I will keep you by my side evermore."

[You have earned five wisdom points and three quest points.]

>KILL GIRL
[with the sword]
The girl's shimmering features dissolve into those of a hideously ugly demon who leers at you through obscene, red eyes. "So, Arthur, you have seen through my little disguise. But as I am feeling generous, I shall make you a bargain. We each have something the other wants. I have the Golden Fleece, without which you cannot claim your kingdom. You have the power to free me. I propose a trade."

"Heed closely the words of my offer, for I will fulfill them to the letter. If you agree to unlock my manacles, I will give you the Golden Fleece and allow you to finish your quest unmolested."

"Remember. If you agree, we will each be bound to the terms of the contract. If you accept my offer, and then fail to honor the contract to the letter, you will die a horribly painful death."

"Do you accept my offer?"

Please answer YES or NO>Y
The demon smiles with pleasure. He allows the fleece to slide onto the floor. "Proceed, then."

Your body temperature returns to normal.

>GET KEY
You remove the key from the demon's neck.

>UNLOCK RIGHT MANACLE
[with the gold key]
You open the right manacle. The demon smiles.

>LOCK RIGHT MANACLE
[with the gold key]
You snap the right manacle shut. The smile vanishes from the demon's face.

>UNLOCK LEFT MANACLE
[with the gold key]
You open the left manacle. The demon catches on to your plan and screams at you in fury. "Trapped! Trapped by my own words. You have won this round, Arthur, but the final victory shall yet be mine, for I now lay a triple curse upon your head."

"You may gain the throne of England, but you shall gain no solace from it. Your wife shall be barren, you shall be betrayed by your best friend, and you shall die at the hand of your own son. Thus have I thrice cursed you."

"Now BEGONE!"
The word comes at you in a explosion of incredible force that blasts you out of the hall, through the outer rooms, and dumps you on the ledge next to the slumbering dragon. The force of the blast dislodges the stones on the mountainside above the cave entrance, and they fall down and seal off the mouth of the cave.

LEDGE

You emerge from the cave and find yourself once again on the ledge. A fierce-looking dragon is passed out in the entrance to the cave.

"Because you have freed me, I too shall help you. Take this gauntlet and use it to challenge King Lot. You will have to fight him upon the Field of Honor, but if you keep your wits about you, he will be at your mercy. When you have dealt with him, call my name.

You walk into the town square. The churchyard lies to the north, and the castle to the east. To your south you see the entrance to the town's only tavern, and to the west is the village green.

The village idiot is here, idly playing with a red piece of glass that lies at his feet. He mumbles, "King Lot is a greedy goat."

>E
OUTSIDE CASTLE GATE

You come to the gate to the castle of evil King Lot. A soldier is standing guard. To the south is the village smithy.

>E
The guard sees the gauntlet and says, "Enter." He opens the massive gate and steps aside as you walk through.

PARADE AREA

You walk inside the castle gate and are now in the parade area of King Lot's castle. The gate in the west wall is guarded by a soldier. The armoury is to the south, the entrance to the Great Hall is to the east, and the kitchen is to the southeast.

>E
GREAT HALL

You trade the bright sunlight for the dark interior of King Lot's Great Hall. It is a large room with a dark, timbered ceiling. King Lot is enthroned on a massive chair in front of an intricately-woven tapestry. He is surrounded by his courtiers.

>THROW GLOVE AT LOT
As you approach the throne, Lot's soldiers close around you. Suddenly, however, they see the gauntlet and draw back, allowing you to step forward to deliver your challenge.

Anger flashes in the evil king's eyes. "Enough!" he cries. "This stripling has impugned the honor of the king. He must answer for it on the Field of Honor."

He stands up and stalks out of the Great Hall. His guards seize you and strip you of everything you were carrying. They thrust a sword into your hand and then they force-march you along behind Lot. The entourage sweeps out of the Castle, into the town, and south to the Field of Honor. Townspeople follow the procession, and by the time the guards turn you loose, you face King Lot man to man, surrounded by a cheering mob.

[You have earned ten chivalry points and five quest points.]

>DROP BRACELET
As you handle the golden bracelet, you pretend to let it slip through your fingers and drop it on the ground. Lot's concentration is broken. His eyes widen at the sight of the gold and he stoops to pick it up.

>FIGHT LOT
[with the sword]
Your gambit is successful. You knock aside Lot's sword and push him to the ground. You are now standing over him with your sword at his throat.

[You have earned seven wisdom points, seven experience points and four quest points.]

>SPARE LOT
You remove your sword. King Lot kneels at your feet and thanks you, swearing eternal loyalty.

[You have earned ten chivalry points.]

>CALL LADY
When you cry out, the winds come up and the sky goes dark. The waters of the lake begin to churn, and suddenly they pull back on either side to reveal a perfectly dry path that leads south to the center of the lake.

[You have earned one experience point and one quest point.]

>S
LAKE

The cheering mob parts on either side of you to allow you to walk to the water's edge. Slowly, you venture out between the two walls of water that are being held back by some magical, unseen force. After a few moments, you reach the center of the lake. Here, the sunken boat rests on dry ground and a shaft of light illuminates the sword in the stone.

Lot and the crowd follow you.

>GET SWORD
You grasp the hilt and pull. At first nothing happens, but then...
The sword slides out easily. You wave it over your head and the crowd cheers, "Long Live King Arthur. The Once and Future King."

THE END


[Congratulations on winning the game.]

Merlin appears before you and says "You have done well, Arthur. Your reign will be long and, at times, peaceful. I must leave you now for a long journey. But rest assured my young friend - when you have need of me, I will be there."

"Because you have one hundred and ten chivalry points, one hundred and three wisdom points, one hundred and one experience points, and one hundred quest points, you have proven yourself worthy of the rank of king."

"Before I go, I shall grant you one final wish. Do you want to Undo, Restore, Restart, Quit, or get a Hint?"
